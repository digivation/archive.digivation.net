So many days have slipped by since the last time I posted! I&#8217;ve been extremly busy over the past couple of weeks with some cool projects that I can&#8217;t wait to tell everyone about (of course, if you ever looked at my Facebook profile, you probably have an idea already). I kinda want to finish some of them so I can do a complete &#8220;start to finish&#8221; post instead of incremental stuff, since we&#8217;re so far along.

In other news, school has started back at my alma mater, and I&#8217;m just fine (as I expected). It&#8217;s great that everyone is back in town, but when they complain about homework or having to go to class or some other drudgery, I just smile and think &#8220;my summer just keeps on going&#8230;&#8221; Of course I kinda might miss the lazy times in between classes, but so far having a job is not any worse than going to school. In fact, I&#8217;m actually starting to think that I might like it better. One of the biggest advantages of having a job and a regular schedule is the chance to get back in shape. I&#8217;ve been taking advantage of the free gym membership on base. After work I walk a few blocks to the gym, spend an hour lifting weights, and then head home &#8211; and I still get done before most people I know!

Anyway, check back in the next few days because I should have a few more writeups done.
