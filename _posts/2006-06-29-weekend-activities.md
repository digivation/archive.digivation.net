Hopefully everyone has returned safely from his or her respective weekends refreshed and ready for yet another week. Personally, I spent my weekend traveling (or that’s how it seemed). After work Friday afternoon, I took off for Auburn to hang out with an acquaintance and experience a little Auburn nightlife. We all went out for dinner and then spent the evening at [Highlands][1] listening to [Trotline][2] (a country band that is somewhat popular around Auburn) and socializing.

Saturday morning I got up and hit the road again, this time for Columbus. Arriving around lunchtime, I ran by my cousin’s house to grab a change of clothes and shower. I then ate lunch with Ryan and Mark (two of my beloved fraternity brothers) and watched “The Man.” After lunch and a movie, I met up with Justin and crew for an afternoon trip to Atlanta for the [Sister Hazel][3] concert, which made for quite an enjoyable evening.

Sunday was spent sleeping, eating, and watching TV, complete with a little wakeboarding action.

I also managed to semi-solidify plans for next weekend (and it’s a long one) – I should stay quite busy (and mobile), with time spent in Macon (Friday night and Saturday morning/afternoon), a possible trip to Atlanta Saturday night, and then heading to the lake Sunday morning. The rest of the weekend is yet to be planned – most likely I will be at Lake Blackshear Sunday, Monday, and part of Tuesday to hang out with Alex and (finally) meet his fiancée.

Sorry it took so long to get another post out – I’ve been getting busier at work, having less time for “other” activities. Till next time, keep it real folks!
