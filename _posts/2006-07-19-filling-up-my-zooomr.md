For those of you looking at Zooomr out of the corner of your eye (so to speak), let me invite you to check out [my photo stream][1]. I have been spent the evening uploading a few of the pictures on my laptop, but I won&#8217;t be able to upload the ones from my desktop, seeing as how it&#8217;s back in Macon while I&#8217;m here in Columbus. To check out more of my shots, visit [my Flickr photostream][2] (yes, I&#8217;m keeping both). While I&#8217;m loading Zooomr, I&#8217;m also taking down a brief list of features which I will post later.
