According to a recent [survey][1], record numbers of developers are moving from Windows to Linux this year. Could this be the [year of the Linux Desktop][2]? While I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s completely ready for the big time, there&#8217;s never been a better time to at least try Linux; there are several easy to use distributions out there &#8211; most recently I&#8217;ve been using [Ubuntu][3].

I think that this is a pretty significant development &#8211; the main &#8220;problem&#8221; that I have with Linux is the lack of some mainstream (commercial) software packages. I&#8217;ve been working to replace them with Open Source equivalents, but sometimes (and for some corporations) this is difficult or impossible. However, if more developers are shifting to Linux, this could signify the beginning of a very impressive change. I, for one, have already determined that I&#8217;m not &#8220;[upgrading][4]&#8221; any of my machines to Vista. It transfers too much power to &#8220;the man,&#8221; and we all hate the man, right?
