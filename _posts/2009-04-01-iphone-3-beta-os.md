Yesterday, the [team application][1] for an iPhone developer account was finally approved. I paid my portion of the fee, the team lead configured my account, and I was off to the races. Since I plan on using the iPhone OS 3.0 beta more for daily use and less for developing, I plan on keeping a log of my experiences as well as any tips and tricks I discover along the way. I also plan on making a long overdue update to the [OTA iPhone Calendar Sync][2] post with all current methods and their benefits/drawbacks. I might even get around to finishing up and posting a few other iPhone related things while I&#8217;m at it.

### The Install

After backing up my iPhone and downloading the sizable update image from the [Developer Center][3], I used my MacBook and iTunes to install the new OS (using Option+Click on the the Restore button). The installation of the new software took around 20 minutes to complete. Once my iPhone rebooted and aquired activation, I connected it to my Windows machine to restore the backup and sync, which took around one and a half hours to complete.

### First Impressions

**Performance**

Prior to installing the beta (version 2), my phone was running a jailbroken copy of OS 2.2 with a lot of extra &#8216;unoffical&#8217; stuff installed, some of which seriously reduced performance. Since my copy of 3.0b2 is not jailbroken, I don&#8217;t have any of these apps installed and as a result, my phone feels much &#8220;snappier&#8221; than before; however, I have no way of knowing how much of a performance change is due to the new OS vs the lack of &#8220;extra baggage.&#8221; Apparently beta 2 resolves most of the performance issues present in beta 1 (I&#8217;ve read reports of people requiring a reboot on a daily basis with the first beta), but since I did not have access to the first beta, I can&#8217;t compare those either. After a few hours of use, however, it seems fast enough for daily use. We&#8217;ll see how this plays out.

*Update: *After using the OS for a few days, I did notice slowdowns that required a reboot to solve. I probably had to reboot my device once every 3 days with beta 2. I&#8217;ve just upgraded to beta 3, so I&#8217;ll soon report back on it&#8217;s stability.

**Discovered Issues**

*   **MMS (b2)**: Apple/AT&T are not supporting MMS during the beta period. There have been mix reports of success and failure on various sites around the &#8216;net. In my experience, it seems to be more of a carrier configuration issue than a software issue. As of yet, I&#8217;ve been unable to send or recieve MMS on my iPhone. I called AT&T and spoke to someone who said she would provision my phone for MMS, but it&#8217;s not working yet. After that modified my icss file according to these instructions. Still no MMS and I&#8217;m no longer recieving text messages when someone sends me one, and I&#8217;m not getting a &#8216;blocked&#8217; response when sending images to the special MMS email address.
*   **Tethering (b2)**: While this needs further investigation, enabling and connecting to my laptop caused some serious performance issues, at least right after enabling. I did not play with this long enough to get online.
*   **Messaging App Landscape Mode (b2)**: Sent message bubbles do not expand/reflow horizontally to take advantage of the wider reading space. They stay the same width as in portrait mode.
*   **Keyboard Crash (b2)**: I&#8217;m not really sure how to classify this, but on at least two occasions the keyboard would show up with all of the letter keys transparent. The number/symbol keys worked fine, however. This only occured in Safari.

*Note: Number in parenthesis indicates the beta version this was noticed in.*

I&#8217;ll be updating this post with further information as I play with the software, so check back to see what&#8217;s new. I will also be updating and creating some additional iPhone related posts in the near future.

*Update:* I have some screenshots that I&#8217;ll be adding soon.
