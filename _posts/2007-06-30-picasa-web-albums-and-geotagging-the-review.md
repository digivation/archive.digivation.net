I merely mentioned the addition of new features as I didn&#8217;t have time to investigate further.

After returning to Macon (where all my pictures reside), I decided to take a deeper look at Picasa Web Albums. I had never used the web albums feature of [Picasa][4] and was a little skeptical of the service (in all honesty, I wish that Google would also allow Picasa to upload photos directly to Facebook). I have accounts on Facebook (great for social photo sharing), Flickr (great for browsing images), and Zooomr (because it was new), but I really only use Facebook due to the large network of friends and the account limits imposed by the other services (however, it would be great if Facebook would store full-size images). Despite my prolonged use of other online photo sharing services, I have never geotagged a picture. For those of you not "in the know," geotagging is the process of adding location information to a picture.

Google makes the process very simple, but does require the use of Picasa to upload photos. I consider this a drawback, as the other services allow the addition of pictures using a globally available web based interface. Once the photos are loaded, a visit to web albums reveals the option to "Map your Photos." Clicking this link takes you to an interactive Google Map with thumbnails of all your photos. To tag a photo, drag and drop the picture over the desired location on the map. Simple as pie.

My only gripe is the size of the thumbnails. There were a few photos that looked similar in my sample album, and the thumbnails were not large enough to clearly differentiate between them. Implementing a mouse-over enlargement for the photos in the side bar would be a tremendous improvement in this area.

It would also seem that Google is now offering 1024 MB of free space for your photographs, so I recommend giving it a spin even if you don&#8217;t plan on using it often. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll upload many more pictures to my web album, but you can view the sample album [here][5]. Be sure and click on "view map" to see the geotagging in action!
