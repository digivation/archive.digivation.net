Have you ever watched a trapped fly making futile escape attempts, repeatedly crashing into a window, then fluttering around dazed before repeating the stunt? With the [Akismet][1] spam filter built into Wordpres, the comment spammers bear quite a resemblance to the aforementioned fly (man that sounded almost like a commercial&#8230;).

A statistic on the front page of Akismet states that &#8220;94% of all comments are spam.&#8221; I must agree; for the 71 legitimate comments currently posted to this site since January 2006, the Akismet filter has captured 7,211 spam comments &#8211; putting my site at an even more astounding ratio: 99.02% of all comments are spam! If I had to manually moderate every single message, I&#8217;d be forced to disable commenting &#8211; but thanks to Akismet and it&#8217;s community of users, I can click a handy &#8220;delete all&#8221; button and \*poof\* no more spam.

Now occasionally I glance over the Akismet spam queue&#8230; and usually its the same old &#8220;Hey nice site, visit mine:&#8221; followed by 15 links titled &#8220;buy zanax now!&#8221; and left by some dimwit named &#8220;Bob&#8221; or &#8220;Bill&#8221; with an email address composed of random letters. Today, however, I had one curious comment awaiting me (not yet marked as spam). It went something like this:

> What would you do if you  
> Knew all of the things we knew  
> Would you stand up for truth  
> Or would you turn away too  
> And then what if you saw  
> All of the things thats wrong  
> Would you stand tall and strong  
> Or would you turn and walk away

Followed by a link to some site I&#8217;d never heard of. Seeing as how this was posted as a comment to the &#8220;About&#8221; page (which doesn&#8217;t even have a comment box) and it didn&#8217;t make a lot of sense, I had to check the link out&#8230; and it appears to belong a [content scraper][2] trying to make an easy buck. So &#8211; a quick click on &#8220;Spam It&#8221; and that problem was solved (for me and every one else using Akismet).

See, Akismet is peer-to-peer spam blocking. By marking a comment as spam, you enter that into the Akismet database and it will be filtered automatically in the future. The power of the network &#8211; like an invisible glass wall for all those stupid spammers!

The moral of the story? Get Akismet&#8230; oh and P2P isn&#8217;t always bad &#8211; in fact, in my opinion, it&#8217;s always good.
