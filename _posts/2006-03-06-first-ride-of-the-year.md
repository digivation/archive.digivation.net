Ladies and gentlemen, it is now March. Time to don your wetsuit and head out to the lake for a little pre-season wakeboarding action. Yesterday I hopped in the jeep and rode out to the lake for a little warm up run before the weather gets warm enough to bring ladies. I was surprised at how quickly I recalled the skills acquired this past summer; this bodes well for the upcoming season. Maybe by next December I&#8217;ll be busting out with a full backroll.
