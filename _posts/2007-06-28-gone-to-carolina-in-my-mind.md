And physically. Or I could go with my alternate title &#8220;North Carolina, Come on and Raise Up&#8221;. Either way, James Taylor and Petey Pablo have something in common, and I am headed to the [Tar Heel State][1]. Not to see any [Tarheels][2] though, actually, to see the marriage of a [Wolfpack][3] (a wolfpack of one?) and a [Blue Devil][4], the latter of which being my sister. So I will be unable to post for a few days, but do not despair, I&#8217;m sure my colleague has plenty in store for you. I plan to take some photos during the course of this journey (which I will be making with my two younger brothers) and upon my return will share some choice ones with you as well as relate few tales of the adventure.

If you are interested, check out their [Wedding Page][5].
