> **Editorial Note**: This is a repost from a previous entry that appeared on digivation before my server crashed. It seems to be one of the most looked for articles here, so I am copying this back over from an archive. Originally posted **12.25.2005**:

Well, it seems that <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/" target="_blank">BoingBoing</a> is on a roll today. Here are two more very interesting (and possibly confusing/controversial) and very funny news posts:

**Christian nudist&#8217;s Garden of Eden**

> Natura, a Christian nudist camp, is slated to open next year north of Tampa, Florida. From the Sunday Times:
> 
> (Founder Bill Martin is) confident that Christians will flock to Natura to experience the spiritual benefits of a lifestyle “free from body shame”. He is spending more than $2m on a nudist recreational complex that will also feature a hotel, campsites and a children’s water park.
> 
> “As evidenced by Adam and Eve, we believe that when God’s children are in the right relationship to Him, they will be naked and unashamed,” explains one of Natura’s brochures&#8230;
> 
> Martin and his supporters argue that nudism is unhealthy, especially for children, unless it occurs in a proper Christian context. He has criticised non- religious nudist camps for encouraging alcohol and sensuality. “We are going after a totally different group, a group that doesn’t want a sexual atmosphere,” he said. “There is absolutely no relationship between nudity and sex.” [<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1938165,00.html" target="_blank">Link</a>]

Right &#8230;. naked Christians &#8230; yep, I&#8217;m staying FAR away from there (oh so very very very far). In other news, possibly of a different but maybe ever so slightly way, Kodak has come up with an amazing, attractive, and potentially lucrative form of advertisement, sure to snag millions of men the world over.

**Kodak assvertises on Ukrainian models&#8217; butts**

> <img src="http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/kodakass1.jpg" class="left" />Snip from thespunker.com: &#8220;[Assvertising][1] was so great you knew it would be copied. (&#8230;) Apparently, Kodak used the derriere media placement during a photo convention in Kiev, Ukraine. At least two hot women were hired to wear ridiculously short mini skirts with Kodak logoed panties underneath and then drops things on the convention floor and pick them up.&#8221; [<a href="http://gattacainc.typepad.com/my_weblog/2005/12/kodak_assvertis.html" target="_blank">Link</a>]

Yea, I agree&#8230; that&#8217;s \_____ (that means, you don&#8217;t actually know &#8217;cause I&#8217;m not admitting to anything!). Till next time, enjoy yourselves!
