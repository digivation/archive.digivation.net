<img class="right" title="Apple Developer Program" src="http://archive.digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/apple_dev.jpg" alt="Apple Developer Program" width="224" height="151" />Just in case you missed it, Apple [announced][1] the latest OS for the iPhone (and iTouch), [version 3.0][2], on Tuesday. It includes a ton of new features, mostly in the programming department (though copy and paste will be a welcome addition, as will the new MMS feature &#8230; no more viewmymessage.com texts!). The OS will be open to consumers in June, but is currently avaliable for registered developers (must be a paid developer, not a free one). Me, being totally impatient about this, was twittering about the OS upgrade and recieved an offer to go in on a dev team and split the cost of membership. This will give me (legal) access to the 3.0 beta OS, the 3.0 SDK, and the ability to test any software I write on the phone itself.

I&#8217;m doing it. I&#8217;ll post my thoughts when I get signed up. And who knows, maybe this will even result in some software for your iPhone!
