Four thousand, one hundred and thirty-three sheets of paper &#8211; the number of individual pages that Max Tyrie and his friends printed to create this hand made stop-motion music video for [Modest Mouse][1] (the video is below).

> &#8220;Myself and a couple have friends have entered the above into the Modest Mouse video competition. Using green screen footage provided by the band we cut a simple music video. We then degraded the images and printed out each frame sequentially. (all 4133 of them) We then nailed each &#8220;shot&#8221; of 50-100 posters to various structures and posts. Then using a digital SLR camera with a long exposure we frame by frame shot each poster. Oh, and theres a little video projection (again, frame by frame on the SLR) just to mix it up. There is no compositing, no shortcuts, just lots of blood, sweat and tears, and a huge Kinkos bill!&#8221;&#8230;. Max ([from][2])

The video is really good and kinda makes me want to try my hand at a little stop-motion film making. Any one [bored][3] this weekend?
