It&#8217;s another wonderful Friday afternoon, and I feel like making a quick &#8220;review&#8221; post. Ready?

*   [Dave][1] and [Des][2] are **engaged**! Wow &#8211; I knew it was in the works but not when (when a guy follows his woman to another school, what do you expect?). Congrats to them!! (**update** &#8211; the [wedding][3] has occurred!)
*   I went wakeboarding this week and **landed a mute grab**. Nothing huge, but hey, its my first grab evar!! Now I just need to get this photographed&#8230;
*   I **almost bought** the new [Sony DSLR-A100][4], but stopped at the last moment. I then read the preview of the new [Nikon D80][5] (released this week). Now I have no idea what I&#8217;m gonna get &#8211; I have to wait for the production model review to decide &#8211; and that&#8217;s at least another month of waiting.
*   Some terrorists almost **blew up some planes**. Now I can&#8217;t take liquids or electronic devices on my next flight. Good thing I wasn&#8217;t planning on flying anytime soon&#8230;
*   Speaking of the terrorists, a lady had to [peel her banana][6] before flying and this other lady likes to [cover NYC with rubber bands][7] (ok so its *technically* called **art**)&#8230;
*   Here&#8217;s a [cool tutorial][8] on turning a photo of a house into something more eriee
*   This is a [gallery of amazing vector art][9]. You really really really won&#8217;t believe this. Really. [[here's a little tutorial][10]]
*   Here&#8217;s a [handy guide to fighting back][9] when those jerks at the RIAA decide to call your number
*   Oh yea, and &#8217;tis high time to [start being more careful][11] when TP&#8217;ing someone&#8217;s house.

Well, I suppose that covers most of it. I&#8217;m spending the weekend in Columbus to attend Ryan and Jenna&#8217;s wedding, so I&#8217;ll try and take some photos to post up (along with a little narrative, perhaps). With all these weddings and engagements, I&#8217;m starting to feel a little &#8220;behind the times.&#8221; Ho well&#8230; &#8217;till next time, &#8220;be cool!&#8221;
