For those of us in the good &#8216;ole US of A, today is Thanksgiving, a celebration of our ancestors&#8217; successful voyage across the Atlantic almost 400 years ago. Today, families from Georgia to Washington stuffed their faces with food and reminisced about the things for which they are thankful.

Myself being a member of a typical American family, I also spent the afternoon with some of my extended family. As the day draws to a close, I would like to mention a few things that I find myself thankful for:

*   A great family
*   Friends
*   A warm place to sleep
*   Great opportunities
*   A car that works
*   And so much more&#8230;

I only wanted to touch on the high points, as a comprehensive list would be quite boring for most. Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!
