With the flurry of new activity and the fact that the current [digivation design][1]/layout is growing rather old (approaching the one year mark), I have been contemplating a redesign of the site. This isn&#8217;t a new idea &#8211; I&#8217;ve never been 100% happy with the current layout and have been brainstorming, sketching and creating mock-ups for several months.

With the [recent addition][2] of another writer and a [plan][3] to write at least sixty posts next month (and keep up the trend in the coming months), the issue of archives and &#8220;lost content&#8221; is coming into play. Currently the only way to find older content is via Google, because for some random reason I disabled the internal search (bad move) or, by browsing the articles using the &#8220;previous posts&#8221; link at the bottom of the main page (at one time I had a real archive section I broke it through various upgrades and changes).

However, simply having a mere &#8220;archives&#8221; page isn&#8217;t going to cut it. I want to devise a more intuitive and user-friendly way for curious readers to find more related content. So far, I hope to implement some of the following (through current and to-be-written plugins and enhancements):

*   Links to Related Posts at the end of each article
*   List of recent comments on the main page (so you can easily find active discussions)
*   Some way of listing popular posts on the front page &#8211; perhaps by votes or by visits
*   Definitely re-enable searching!
*   Tag cloud?
*   Better structure and tagging of pre-existing and future articles (this will require going back and editing the 100+ articles currently in the archives)

These are just a few preliminary ideas that I have come up with while contemplating the future design of digivation (and I am aware of the plugin options for implementing these ideas). I also hope to keep the layout open enough to integrate the dis-used photo gallery into the site.

Over the next few days and weeks, I&#8217;ll be creating mock-ups and looking for inspiration. If you have any suggestions or ideas on how to tackle some of the outlined problems, please do not hesitate to leave a comment!
