This is a random and intriguing idea that I came up with the other day.

I want to create a private wiki (and by private, I mean really, really (really) private). This wiki would be accessible only by me, and would contain all those bits of random knowledge that so easily slips your mind after a few days.

The topics of this wiki could range from notes about certain people (friends, enemies, the president) to solutions to obscure problems that I run across (how to fix that annoying squeak on my Jeep). The possibilities are endless, and because of a wiki&#8217;s free-form nature, the assimilation of meandering topics would be quite simple.

Of course organizing this mess would be a nightmare&#8230;

There are a few problems with this. First off, security would be paramount &#8211; you don&#8217;t want someone reading your deepest thoughts do you? Secondly, how do you organize such a beast, so that one, five, or ten years down the road you can still find what you&#8217;re looking for? And thirdly, you need an easy way to update this from anywhere, so the wiki would need to support a WAP interface (or accept text messages and turn them into topics).

At the moment, this is nothing more than a brief idea I coined working on a project (don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s no secret website with intimate details about you &#8211; at least not that I know of). And while having a little black book of people is a pretty odd idea &#8211; but somewhere to keep all those tips, tricks, and random bits of information would be pretty cool. If I ever get around to working on something like this, I&#8217;ll inform you of all the juicy details.
