Since the last round of keyword investigations, we have started posting a lot and have added another name to the bill. Yesterday, Chappie (whom has also become intrigued with this phenomena), informed me that searches for [Matthew Smith][4] returned digivation.net as result number sixteen. It seems that [Michael Chappell][5] has not yet broken into the limelight, but I&#8217;m sure that will change quickly &#8211; there are far fewer Michael Chappells then Matthew Smiths. However, searching for [Matthew Smith Michael Chappell][6] strikes gold (number one) &#8211; it would seem that we are the only dynamic duo using those names.

With the recent level of increased web site productivity, we have also been turning up for a variety of other search terms related to the various articles found here. Google, working exactly as it should!

In other news, tagging has now been enabled and I have gone back and tagged all prior articles (in addition to performing a little spell-checking). This should make it somewhat easier to find relevant content!
