![The Newtons: Live!][1]

Sorry to disappoint but the Newtons aren&#8217;t playing live anytime soon (not that I know of anyway). Fortunately I do happen to have this great set of live recordings (previously mentioned [here][2]) just waisting away on the server&#8230; so I figured I might as well share! This is the **entire live concert** (edited down to tracks) and presented for the first time ever!

I&#8217;m sure this will only interest a few, but give it a shot. If you like it, you&#8217;d love the (much better) EP, which was actually recording using &#8220;normal&#8221; methods and has a much better sound quality. However, the Live album is the only place to find some of their great covers. Enjoy!

PS, I&#8217;m sure those of you with sharp eyes will notice that the pictures and recordings are not from the same concert. However, they&#8217;re the only ones I had available.

**The Newtons are**:

> Andy Carter &#8211; Bass  
> [David Comeaux][3] &#8211; Vocals/Guitar  
> Alex Daugherty &#8211; Vocals/Guitar  
> David Milligan &#8211; Keyboard  
> Stephen Spalding &#8211; Percussion

Play it below, or download the tracks [here][4].
