Ok, maybe not quite the madness it used to be, but it will still be exciting. The difference is this year&#8217;s festivities are &#8220;invitation only&#8221; and will be held in several hotel conference rooms in <a href="http://www.smgov.net/home/index.asp">Santa Monica, CA</a> as opposed to the <a href="http://www.lacclink.com/">Los Angeles Convention Center</a>. The viewing crowd will be reduced from 30,000 to around 5,000, and although the event will be scaled down for the most part, we are all still expecting incredible announcements from our favorite game and system developers. I will be reading the reports and will sum up all you need to know afterwards, or if you just can&#8217;t contain yourself, I&#8217;m sure you will be able to find some sort of press releases at any of their websites: <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/">Microsoft Xbox</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/home">Nintendo</a>, <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/">Sony Playstation</a>, <a href="http://www.activision.com/en_US/home/home.jsp">Activision</a>, <a href="http://www.ea.com/home.jsp">Electronic Arts</a>, <a href="http://www.midway.com/rxpage/MidwayHome.html">Midway</a>, <a href="http://www.konami.com/">Konami</a>, or you could check out the site apparently covering the conference: <a href="http://www.e3expo.com/">E3</a>.
