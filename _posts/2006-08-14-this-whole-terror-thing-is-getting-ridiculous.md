Ok, so now we call people terrorists and arrest them for [buying a bunch of cell phones][1]. Oh, and then talk about becoming [more invasive of personal privacy][2] [[via][3]]. Sheesh, what is the world coming too? Seeing as how [terrorism is intended to create terror][4], and we&#8217;re becoming more paranoid every day&#8230; well &#8211; who&#8217;s winning this one [[also related][5]]?

I would like to know a few things; first, whatever happened to &#8220;innocent until proven guilty?&#8221; Second, how would the situation have ended if the van was driven by a few nice non-Arab folk? I think I see those fundamental American rights flying out that window over there. I&#8217;m ready for something new, cause I&#8217;m getting tired of this.

**Update**: As surmised, they have been [declared innocent][6].

**Update 2 (8.18.06)**: Ok, now its just silly. Check out [this][7]!
