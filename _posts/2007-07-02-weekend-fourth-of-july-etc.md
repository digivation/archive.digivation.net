I attended my first [Macon Music][1] game, highlighted by a rousing performance of the National Anthem by my friend Sam. Other than that, the game was uneventful and the weather was oppressive. I&#8217;m not even sure who won since we left halfway through the seventh inning.

On Sunday afternoon I went to watch [Ratatouille][2] with some friends, which turned out to be a very &#8220;cute and entertaining&#8221; movie. I&#8217;m almost certain that&#8217;s the first G-rated movie I&#8217;ve seen in a looong time, but I enjoyed it anyway. The characters were quite likable (despite a certain rat-like appearance) and the storyline was engaging and playful. If you&#8217;re unsure about it, just go to a matin√©e showing.

It is certainly one of the coolest phones I&#8217;ve ever seen, with a beautiful display and intuitive user interface. Navigating around did not take long to figure out, though there were a few instances when I would have to hunt to figure something out, but you could easily get accustomed to using it in a day or two.

For Independence Day, I&#8217;m planning on heading back to Macon (despite the additional driving, it will be more fun than staying in LaGrange or Columbus). I believe we&#8217;re grilling out for dinner and then heading to the country club to watch the firework show. If you&#8217;re interested in joining our holiday celebrations, call me.
