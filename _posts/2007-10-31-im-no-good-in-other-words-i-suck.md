I must also apologize to Chappie, because the editor has been &#8220;broken&#8221; since I upgraded [WordPress][1] to version 2.3. However, it&#8217;s fixed now and everything has been upgraded to the latest versions.

Chappie, if you have any problems let me know.

Now I&#8217;m off to write some real content.
