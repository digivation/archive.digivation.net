On **January 16, 2008**, I, Matthew Smith, will be delivering a presentation for STC on the use of wikis in collaborative writing projects. This presentation will be based on a shorter presentation I gave for one of my technical communications classes last year. I don&#8217;t have the final details on the presentation yet (aside from the date), but I&#8217;m assuming it will be in <strike>the auditorium</strike> **room 201** of the new [Science and Engineering Building][1] <strike>around 7pm</strike> **at 6pm**(that&#8217;s on Mercer&#8217;s Macon campus if you didn&#8217;t know). I hope that the presentation will be informative and inspire people to find new ways to employ the versatile wiki. If you&#8217;re not busy, I&#8217;d love it if you dropped by!
