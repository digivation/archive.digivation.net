**Problem 1**: When I returned to the computer, I had some fifteen &#8220;undeliverable emails&#8221; that appeared to be sent from some random @digivation.net email. After investigating the logs and poking around, it would seem some jerkoff is [spoofing email addresses using my domain][1]. Unfortunately there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it (read the article for background info).

**Problem 2**: All pages besides the homepage are returning 404 errors. Everything seemed to be working fine a couple of hours ago, so I&#8217;m not sure what happened. I was playing around with my [.htaccess file][2] earlier, so it&#8217;s possible I messed it up. This problem hasn&#8217;t been solved yet, but I&#8217;m working on it. You can browse the site by clicking on links, but most links you follow here from google or elsewhere will be broken until I repair redirects.

**Update**: It seems everything is fixed except for Gallery. I&#8217;ll try to have that back up later.

**Final Update**: Looks like everything is back to normal, more or less!
