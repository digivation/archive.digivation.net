Of course this doesn&#8217;t mean anything for you yet (unless you want to write your own software for the iPhone), but if you&#8217;re looking for something a little more practical, grab yourself a copy of [iFuntastic 2.0][2] (for free, of course) and get busy installing those custom ringtones, changing your carrier logo, and tinkering with your icons!
