An email from AT&T/Cingular just arrived in my inbox informing me of the new store locater that will enable you find the closest AT&T Store selling <strike>cocain</strike> [iPhones][1] on Friday. If you&#8217;re all rev&#8217;d up from my [last post][2] on the subject, you can search for those precious stores [here][3].

> With iPhone arriving June 29th at 6 p.m. in AT&T retail stores, the wait is almost over. Use our online store locator to find the closest AT&T store that sells Apple iPhone (limit one per person). We&#8217;ll show you maps, directions, and everything you need to get your hands on an iPhone as quickly as possible.

**Update**: someone has created a [cool Google maps mashup][4] to help you locate the iPhone.
