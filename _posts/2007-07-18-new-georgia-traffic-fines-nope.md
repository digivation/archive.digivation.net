I was visiting some friends in Columbus last night when this little tidbit crossed within earsight (not an exact quote):

> &#8220;I heard that they just passed this new law that gives you a like $200 ticket for talking on your cellphone without a hands free device and that they will pull you over if you are more than 3 MPH over the speed limit, instead of 9 MPH.&#8221;

This sounded a little fishy to me, but what do I know; I don&#8217;t watch the news or read the papers (they&#8217;re usually full of the same old BS day after day, it tires me). However, I do believe in perusing the &#8220;internets&#8221; for my information.

According to [Snopes][1] and the [Georgia DMV][2], this (circulating email rumor) is FALSE. The fines have not been increased, etc etc. Oh, and you can be pulled over for 1 MPH over the speed limit, but it has always been like that &#8211; it&#8217;s up to the officer.

Now get in your car and go do a little speeding &#8211; please talk on your celly while doing it, okay?

Read this if you wanna know more about [Georgia laws][3].
