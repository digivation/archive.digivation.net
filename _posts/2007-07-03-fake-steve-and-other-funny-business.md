If you&#8217;ve never visited the site of [Fake Steve][1], I recommend having a read. He occasionally gets referenced on other sites, so I stopped by to check it out. Funny stuff &#8211; try this quote on for size:

> iPhone has already saved a life. A young woman in southern California called to tell us that she accidentally locked her keys inside her car, and her dog, a tiny bichon frise, was in there too. Luckily she had her iPhone in her purse and was able to call for help. The dog was fine. &#8220;The police told me that if I hadn&#8217;t been using an iPhone, things might not have turned out so well,&#8221; she told us. &#8220;They all said that they&#8217;re getting iPhones for every member of their families, just for safety reasons. I hope you will let people know about iPhone&#8217;s special safety characteristics. And thank you, Steve Jobs. God bless you for what you&#8217;ve done for the world.&#8221;

> Much love, iPhone lady. Namaste. Peace be unto you. And your little dog too.

In other news, [bottled water][2] [sucks][3]. It kills things and takes all your money. [Don&#8217;t][4] [buy][5] [bottled][6] [water][7], you&#8217;re killing the environment, little kitties, and children in third world countries. You complain about pollution and global warming, then drink stuff that contributes to these things. Silly, silly little <strike>man</strike> <strike>woman</strike> person. Just suck it up and drink from the tap. Not that I care about the environment or anything.

Oh, and AllOfMp3.com [may have shut down][8], but it&#8217;s back again &#8211; under a different [name][9]. Suck that, RIAA!

Finally, you should, in your spare time, watch the [TED talks][10]. You will learn of some amazing technology that could compose the future of computing (and other stuff). Worth your time.
