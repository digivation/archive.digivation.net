<img class="left" style="float: left;" src="http://wordpress.org/about/images/dandy-logo.png" alt="Wordpress!" />I just finished upgrading to the newest version of WordPress. So far, I must say that the administration back-end has received a fantastic overhaul and I&#8217;m enjoying the new features so far.

I will soon update the theme to take advantage of the new features, but until then I can&#8217;t really comment on the coding aspects (but I know they&#8217;re sound). Anyway, I&#8217;d highly recommend [updating][1] if you use WordPress.
