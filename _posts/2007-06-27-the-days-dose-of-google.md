And now, for some Googley Goodness:

**Google Docs Interface Update**

Google has given [Google Docs][1] a makeover. Flashy new icons, a nice list of all your documents (separated by date), and a new sidebar with various view options (including the all-new ability to organize your documents into folders) greets you upon login. The editor interface (from my brief review) is not significantly changed for Documents or Spreadsheets, though I did notice the new ability to create charts in your spreadsheets (this may be old news, but it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve noticed it). Looking good, looking good &#8230; now when do we get [gDrive][2]? That&#8217;s the feature I really want. Via [TechCrunch][3] and the [Google Blog][4].

**Geotagging for Picasa (web albums) and Picasa on your Phone**

Apparently you can now [Geotag][5] your [Picasa web albums][6] for viewing in [Google Earth][7] or on [Google Maps][8]. Additionally, there is a new mobile interface so you can view your web albums on your phone. I&#8217;m more interested in the ability to geotag photos than the ability to look at my pictures on the phone (since I&#8217;m still in the dark ages with no data plan on my phone), but I&#8217;m sure the mobile interface will be great for many people. I am yet to use Picasa web albums (I have used Flickr and Facebook, in addition to my hosted and currently private photo gallery), but may give them a spin with the introduction of this feature. Read more about it on the [Google Blog][9].
