In the news:

*   Google has [announced][1] it&#8217;s acquisition of [GrandCentral][2], which I previously mentioned [here][3]. I can&#8217;t wait to see how this gets integrated into Google&#8217;s current offerings.
*   Several 7-11s around the country [seem][4] to have become [Kwik-E-Marts][5] to promote the [Simpsons Movie][6]. I really wish we had some around here&#8230;
*   [Dave][7] has converted to [WordPress][8]!
