I have found what may be the [funniest Wikipedia article ever][1]. It makes me think of a stiff ninety year old man trying to sound &#8220;hip&#8221; and &#8220;cool.&#8221; Fo sho, homie&#8230;

Anyway, I love the &#8220;Dirty South.&#8221; Despite the fact that we spend the majority of the year sweating our <strike>skinny as-</strike> butts off, gnats and mosquitoes are everywhere, and the Braves suck half the time, we still have good friendly folk, delicious food, and vastly varying culture. And where else could you see something like this parked between a low-rider and a truck rollin&#8217; on 44&#8242;s?

No where. Now while that car (which belongs to [Darren McFadden][2]) might not quite qualify as being from the &#8220;[Dirty South][3],&#8221; I swear to you, I&#8217;ve seen at least five of these in [Macon][4]. And Macon is smack dab in the middle of the Dirty South. We also have <strike>big</strike> huge trucks and some really awful low-riders (not that like the stuff you see in Miami or California), so I&#8217;m pretty sure you can take an afternoon visit to the local movie theater and find all three of these vehicles.

Would you like some lemonade with that?
