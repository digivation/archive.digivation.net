While I sincerely appreciate my &#8220;partner in crime&#8221; looking out for my well being (and plan to print out a copy of the &#8220;[how to not get caught speeding][1]&#8221; list), it would appear that the good &#8216;ole Catholic church has decided to make a few decrees of their own. I present you the &#8220;[Ten Commandments of Driving][2].&#8221;

> 1. You shall not kill.
> 
> 2. The road shall be for you a means of communion between people and not of mortal harm.
> 
> 3. Courtesy, uprightness and prudence will help you deal with unforeseen events.
> 
> 4. Be charitable and help your neighbor in need, especially victims of accidents.
> 
> 5. Cars shall not be for you an expression of power and domination, and an occasion of sin.
> 
> 6. Charitably convince the young and not so young not to drive when they are not in a fitting condition to do so.
> 
> 7. Support the families of accident victims.
> 
> 8. Bring guilty motorists and their victims together, at the appropriate time, so that they can undergo the liberating experience of forgiveness.
> 
> 9. On the road, protect the more vulnerable party.
> 
> 10. Feel responsible toward others.

Hmm well there you have it. Thankfully I&#8217;m not Catholic, so this (obviously) doesn&#8217;t apply to me. Whew &#8211; I can still use my car as an &#8220;expression of power and domination&#8221; without fear!

In other news, Ferrari, in a bold pope-defying move, has been quick to ensure drivers everywhere that [its cars are not a sin][3] to own. Not to worry, they say. Their cars are not intended &#8220;as a means for outshining other people and arousing a feeling of envy.&#8221;

Nooooo heaven forbid!!

Like I said, I&#8217;m not Catholic. Whooooo! I&#8217;m off to save up for that brand new Ferrari!
