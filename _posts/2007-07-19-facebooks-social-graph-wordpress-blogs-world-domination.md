Last night as I was showering, a brilliant idea dawned on me: What if I could combine Facebook&#8217;s social graph with my WordPress blog? Integrated commenting, latests posts showing up on my feed, etc etc etc. I was all set to write this spiffy post outlining some new ideas and proposing a new plugin when I ran across [this][1].

Seems they [beat me to it][2]. Oh well &#8230; Unfortunately it only works with [WordPress.com][3] blogs for now, but the possibility of opening the functionality to hosted blogs (such as this one) will come if we ask for it (or write it ourselves). I am not using a WordPress.com blog, so I can&#8217;t tell you if it works well or not, but you can read more about it [here][4] if you&#8217;re interested.

The best part? The story excerpts in your feed link straight to the blog post!Â  I currently use the Facebook Notes RSS import feature, which requires several clicks to arrive at the actual post&#8230; rather annoying.
