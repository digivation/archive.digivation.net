<img class="right" src="http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/scripture-and-discernment.jpg" alt="scripture-and-discernment.jpg" />For the second paper in my Christianity class, I had to discuss [Luke Johnson&#8217;s][1] [*Scripture and Discernment: Decision Making in the Church*][2]. I present it to you in all its&#8217; glory, PDF style [here][3]. And only eighteen minutes after I turned it in! Talk about hot off the press&#8230;
