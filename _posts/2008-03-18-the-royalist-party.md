Read [this page][1] and you might be a little confused. Apparently the author wishes to bring monarchy to the United States enough to write a web page (in some form of what appears to be Middle English) all about it. Go read and then bring me your thoughts (in the form of comments).

I hope one of their first goals isn&#8217;t reverting to [Middle English][2].
