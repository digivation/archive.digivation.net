> *   Break DMG Password \*COMPLETE\*
> *   Break Activation \*COMPLETE\*
> *   Download a Faked dmg
> *   Unlock Phone
> *   Run Third Party Applications
> *   Allow DUN/Tethering
> *   Remove IMEI Transmitting
> *   Enable Disk Mode

The broken activation does not mean that you can use the phone on any network. It does mean, however, that the iPod and other non-phone features can be used without service. The cool stuff happens when they figure out how to unlock the phone. I give it two more weeks. Oh and added cool factor: one of the devs in the group is from the ATL!
