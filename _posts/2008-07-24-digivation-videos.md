Just a quick blurb: I recently purchased a Canon HF10 HD video camera (which I love), and I&#8217;ve been putting bits and pieces of video online at Vimeo (which is totally awesome). You can watch them in HD from my [profile page][1]!

You should sign up for a Vimeo account and add me as a contact. If you have video to upload, even better! The quality is much better than Youtube and the site just feels &#8220;nicer.&#8221;
