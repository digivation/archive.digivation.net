I&#8217;m missing in action this week because in addition to the rote work of the week, I&#8217;m attempting to assemble my thoughts on Luke T. Johnsons&#8217; book [*Scripture and Discernment*][1]. If you couldn&#8217;t figure it out, this paper is for my Christianity class (as was the [last one][2]) and I&#8217;ll be posting it up once I finish it. The rub? It&#8217;s due next Monday and I&#8217;m going to be out of town all weekend &#8211; so I need to finish this by Friday. Yay.
