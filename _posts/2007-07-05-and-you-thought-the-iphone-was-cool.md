[T-Mobile][1] has recently released the &#8220;[HotSpot @Home][1]&#8221; phone system. It is a hybrid GSM/WiFi phone that seamlessly switches to run on your local wireless router whenever you are in range. The benefits of such a system include an excellent signal in your home and minutes not deducted from your wireless account (while on WiFi). Not only will this work from your home, but also any T-Mobile hot spot or any other wireless network with which your phone is configured to connect. Of course an extra charge would be tacked on your bill, but I wonder if you can surf the net without a per minute charge&#8230;? Now, if only this wasn&#8217;t T-Mobile, which has pathetic reception here in the southeast. T-Mobile gets this, [AT&T][2] gets their <strike>apocalypse device</strike> iPhone, when is anyone gonna show [Verizon ][3]some love?
