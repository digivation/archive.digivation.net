If you havn&#8217;t tried [Google Reader][1] yet, I recommend giving it a spin. It&#8217;s been my RSS viewer of choice for some time now, due to its simple interface and the fact that I didn&#8217;t have to signup for another service (its one of Google&#8217;s many web apps). Recently, Google Reader has been updated with many new features that make staying on top of the latest updates a breeze. Recommended!
