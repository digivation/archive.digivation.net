Never fear, I&#8217;m still here. I&#8217;m just busy trying to get moved into my new place and adjust to life after college. I start my new job at Robins AFB on Monday, June 23rd. Sometime after I get situated in that, I&#8217;ll be back with fresh new words for the site, so stay tuned.  
Ps, you should come by the new house if you haven&#8217;t been yet. It&#8217;s pretty awesome.
