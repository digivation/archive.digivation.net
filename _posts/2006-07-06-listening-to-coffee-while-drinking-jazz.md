Don&#8217;t you love those slips of the tongue? They always seem to strike at an appropriate time and add that extra dose of humor to a situation &#8211; take today for example. I was en route to work this morning (my daily 45 minute commute), sipping on a cup of Mocha Nut Coffee and listening to a selection of [Thelonious Monk][1] jazz (I bet you didn&#8217;t know I was that refined). Suddenly, I thought to myself (yes, I am capable of thought) &#8220;strange &#8230; I&#8217;m listening to coffee and while drinking jazz&#8230; this isn&#8217;t normal for me.&#8221; That little slip put a grin on my face for a good three miles of GA Highway 219. So I challenge you to look out for the little slips in life &#8211; the next time you listen to your coffee while drinking your jazz, it might just be a good time to take a break from that solemn stare and crack a smile. After all, laughter *is* good for the soul.

**Update:** On further reflection, the aforementioned slips might not present themselves at *socially* appropriate times, but still provide great humor (and possible embarrassment). Remember the last time you said &#8220;Ruddfuckers&#8221; instead of &#8220;[Fuddruckers][2]?&#8221;
