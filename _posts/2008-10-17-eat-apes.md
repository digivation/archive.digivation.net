It&#8217;s late on a Friday afternoon and I&#8217;m watching the clock count down the last mintues of the day. Thankfully, I remembered my friends David and Jon keep their musings online (much like Chappie and myself, though Jon posts a lot more than Chappie). You should probably skip on over to [this link][1] and find out why you should eat an ape.

> 6. Eating is perpetuating life. In the case of humans eating animals, the eating of animals is therefore perpetuating the capacity for morality, which perpetuates morality itself. ***Eating animals serves the highest ethical good.***

Also, for those suffering an extra few minutes before the weekend arrives, this [about page][2] is quite entertaining.
