This morning&#8217;s purusal of the interwebs presented me with a particularly interesting gem: a goodÂ [article about MP3 decoding][1]. It&#8217;s written with a nice overview of the format and builds up to a limited but functional bit of code that can actually decode an MP3. Even if you aren&#8217;t into programming, I&#8217;d recommend skimming it, as it&#8217;s nice to know more about something so commonplace but usually never given a second thought.
