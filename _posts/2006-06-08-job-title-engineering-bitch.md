However you cut the cake, I get to do the bitch work &#8211; that repetitive mindless stuff, like copying updates from one AutoCAD drawing to another, or submitting forms to pass the bureaucratic red tape. Before we go any further, let me assure you that **I don&#8217;t mind**; I view this as an opportunity to do the following:

*   further my resume
*   make a lot of cash (relatively speaking)
*   learn a few new skills
*   get used to office life

While some may detest this sort of work, I view it as a rite of passage for young engineers. I&#8217;m certain that every other engineer out there has put in their time slavishly filling out forms, copying changes, and making repetitive edits for a senior engineer. Thus, when I get to fill the shoes of &#8220;older engineer,&#8221; I&#8217;ll be sure and hire a young, bright, trainable engineering mind to do my dirty work. Then I can focus more on the real &#8220;engineering&#8221; of the job and let them learn about the tedious aspects of life.

All in all, things really aren&#8217;t that bad &#8211; I get to do some work here and there, go investigate some parts on the plant floor, devise some revisions, and surf the internet (a lot). I do work <strike>for</strike> with and entire group of engineers, so I get to <strike>be passed around like the village bicycle</strike> experience a variety of work. Oh, and did I mention that I&#8217;m making a lot of money?
