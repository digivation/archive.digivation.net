If not, I highly recommend the experience, as it is quite refreshing. Last night, after a long days&#8217; work (and washing my car), I went out for my daily run. About three minutes in, the rain started coming down a few drops at a time, and by the time I completed my first lap, the floodgates were opened. After becoming thoroughly drenched to the bone, the run was quite pleasant and offered a welcome change to the 100+ F weather we&#8217;ve been having lately.

So next time it rains, don&#8217;t sit around the house. Go running!
