Sure, [Google][5] has the market on what people are looking for, but [Facebook][6] has the ace up its sleeve, that is, the social network. Some may argue that [MySpace][7] is bigger, but [Facebook][8] is gaining ground and has an arguably better network. Now, you might ask what advantages would having this network give [Facebook][8] over the search giant? The answer is distribution. Every new application and feature becomes instantly viral, no advertising needed. Once somebody has added something, a friend will notice and follow, and then their friends, etc. creating a huge snowball effect of distribution. With this sort of power, anything is possible. Perhaps the suits at [Google][9] (they have suits?) don&#8217;t consider direct competition with the social networking crowd just yet, but as they [expand their ventures][10], you never know where they will end up.
