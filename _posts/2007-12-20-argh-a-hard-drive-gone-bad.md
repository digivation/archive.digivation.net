Over the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been working on an extensive project for my Aunt (there will be more details on that one later) and have been putting my lovely computer through the paces. I must say, the beastly Core2Quad definitely gets work done! I would like two more gigs of ram, but thats for another day&#8230;

Last night while I was working away (right after I got done with an episode of House), several programs froze up and I couldn&#8217;t get back to the desktop so I restarted the system, to no avail. After poking around for a while, I found the culprit: a two year old 250GB SATA driveÂ  (it&#8217;s not my system drive and it didn&#8217;t contain the files I was working on, thankfully). Apparently, if Windows can&#8217;t read one of the drives (this is one of five hard drives I have connected) during boot, it hangs and gives you a nice black, uninformative screen while it hangs attempting to read the file system from the bad drive.

The heat situation in my computer is rather bad (need more fans), so I&#8217;m hoping a little cool down time will allow me to copy the data off the drive. I may have to resort to the freezer method, however. I guess it&#8217;s time to buy another hard drive and some fans.
