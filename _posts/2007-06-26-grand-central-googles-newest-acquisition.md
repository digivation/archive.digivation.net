Immediately intrigued by what Google could possibly be up to now, and having never heard of &#8220;Grand Central,&#8221; I proceeded to investigate. After reading through their laundry list of [features][3], I think that this acquisition will pave the way for a host of exciting new Google tricks &#8211; and with that oh-so-slick GoogleApps interface we all <strike>love</strike> <strike>hate</strike> enjoy using. In fact, I&#8217;m not exactly sure how I managed to miss this one when they rolled out their beta service last October.

**<big>What It Is, Yo?</big>**

According to the main page of the website, Grand Central claims to be the &#8220;new way to use your phones,&#8221; and lists some of its biggest features: [one number][4] for all your phones (home, work, cell), [one voicemail][5] box (with a ton of really neat tricks), and &#8220;So Many [other] Features, you won&#8217;t believe it.&#8221;

I have just signed up for the service and the feature list does make me drool bit. Try these highlights on for size:

*   **Call Screening** &#8211; listen to voicemail as it is recorded (and pick up the phone if you wish)
*   **Caller Blocking **
*   **Personalized Voicemail Greetings** &#8211; you can have a different greeting depending on **who calls**
*   **Personalized Rings** &#8211; different callers hear different ring tunes (MP3s you upload over the web)
*   **Visual Voicemail** &#8211; if you have web access on your phone, you don&#8217;t need an iPhone to have visual, random access voicemail

And these are only a small subset of the features. I can imagine that Google plans on integrating these things into existing products, such as Gmail (you could get your email and voicemail, all in one place). At any rate, I think the service is pretty cool. I can&#8217;t really review it at the moment, because I just signed up. The only difficulty is that to fully use the service, you must get all your friends to call a new number &#8211; and I happen to like my current phone number, and don&#8217;t feel like getting everyone to change. However, it will be fun to play with!

Fun bonus: you can get a number in <strike>any</strike> almost any area code you fancy&#8230;
