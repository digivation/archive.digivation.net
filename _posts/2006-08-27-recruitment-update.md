It&#8217;s been a few days since my last post. Never fear, I&#8217;m still alive and well, although a tad on the stressed out side (which you should find rather odd if you know me) as I am in charge of recruitment. On the bright side, we&#8217;re doing quite nicely and I believe I&#8217;m still on track for my goal of thirty pledges.

Since I&#8217;m so horridly busy, check the archives for interesting stuff and then check back later for new goodies. I&#8217;ll be sure to post up more recruitment info after life calms back down a little. Additionally, pictures of &#8220;Lake Day&#8221; should be coming around soon.
