I don&#8217;t know how many of you have seen [this test][1] (warning: those with weak stomachs might be a little offended at some of the later questions) that David pointed out to me the other day. The test is most entertaining and I recommend you take it &#8211; it opens up the possibility of conclusively comparing your debaucheries to those of your friends! Let the comparisons begin! The purest person in the room came out at 91%, while the worst was 61%. I think this should become the new thing:

> **Scene**: A darkly lit and noisy bar.
> 
> **Me**: Hey there hottie.
> 
> **Unknown Hottie**: Why hello!
> 
> **Me**: I&#8217;m only 65% pure. How bout you?
> 
> **Strange Hottie**: Oooo I&#8217;m 75% pure
> 
> **Me**: Wanna go work on decreasing that? I bet I can knock 10% off in the next 30 minutes!

It&#8217;s also a funny way to compare yourself to your friends, with the brilliant suggestion of a &#8220;Purity Test Party.&#8221; Go on, you know you want to!

Oh, and friends: I think we&#8217;ll have to hold one of those parties.
