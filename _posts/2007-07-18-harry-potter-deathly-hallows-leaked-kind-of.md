<img src="http://archive.digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/hpdhcover.thumbnail.jpg" alt="harry potter and the deathly hallows" align="right" />It seems the great &#8220;internets&#8221; have brought us a pre-release copy of the latest Harry Potter book , snagged with a digital camera. I won&#8217;t be reading it because I haven&#8217;t read any of the other books and I really don&#8217;t care all that much &#8211; no offense. Apparently the quality is kinda low in some places (after all, its a bunch of pictures of the pages), but from my understanding, it&#8217;s readable.

But if you just can&#8217;t wait (perhaps your interest was piqued by my [college&#8217;s post][1]), I suppose a search for &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; at some site like [this][2] might just sedate you for a few days. I&#8217;ll have you know that I haven&#8217;t downloaded or searched for this book, I&#8217;m just repeating [something][3] I [read][4] because it makes me smile. More power to the all knowing &#8220;internets!&#8221;
