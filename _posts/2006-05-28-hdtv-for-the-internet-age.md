While engaging in some light reading Friday afternoon, I ran across a blurb on a new &#8220;Internet TV&#8221; show, [Mariposoa][1]. After a little research, I learned that the entire show is filmed, edited, and produced by four ordinary guys with a little time and some nice (but still consumer level) equipment. The show is &#8220;broadcast&#8221; (if you can really call this broadcasting) solely online in 720p or 1080i HD formats and makes use of the bittorrent protocol for distribution. I have watched the three available episodes, and I must say that it is quite impressive to see what these guys have accomplished. This certainly does hold potential for a new era of online broadcasting, bringing television and video in the same directions as blogging have brought the web. Check out some of the episodes (or at least the [galleries][2]), and let me know what you think. This has definitely started the mind-wheels turning&#8230;
