In order to keep ourselves out of hot water, I have resorted to amassing a few handy resources. In case you are also contemplating risky journalism, I recommend you visit these links and make sure that you cover your bases.

> [EFF&#8217;s Legal Guide for Bloggers][1] &#8211; This is a great resource, presented as a list of questions related to various topics. The guide is very easy to read and covers a wide variety of topics, including intellectual property law, defamation law, copyright law, and much more. If you only read one guide, I&#8217;d recommend reading this one. ([via][2])
> 
> [Legal Guide for Podcasters][3] &#8211; while we are yet to enter the podcasting game, it has been discussed as a possible future addition. This guide could come in quite handy! ([via][3])

Now go exercise your right to [Freedom of Speech][4]!
