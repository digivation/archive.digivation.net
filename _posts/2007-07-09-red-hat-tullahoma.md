Now, if I lived in Chicago, New York, or Atlanta, this would not be so surprising. I live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullahoma,_Tennessee">Tullahoma</a>, population 18,000. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat">Red Hat</a> is one of the biggest companies developing and supporting the open source software movement. Oh yeah, and they are the largest distributor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>. I have no idea what this local office is up to, but I intend to find out.
