I&#8217;ve returned from Louisiana (which was amazing and will be getting a post shortly) and I&#8217;m swamped with work. When I get a break from my class work, I&#8217;ll mention get on it, so to speak.

At any rate, I have indeed returned from my 1,100 mile trek across the southern states in one piece.
