A cool new feature for WordPress &#8211; the <a href="http://automattic.com/code/widgets/" title="Automattic / Widgets" target="_blank">sidebar Widget</a>. Distributed as an easy to install plugin for WordPress, these spiffy new gadgets provide easy customization of the sidebar (that thing with links to site sections, login, registration, etc). Prior to the release of the Widget plugin, sidebar customization involved hand editing of the current site theme. Now from the comfort of a nice AJAX interface, I can add and rearrange new content on the sidebar. Cool.

Thankfully, this plugin arrived before I completed (or have even gotten very far into) the new site theme. Obviously, WordPress needs to know how to integrate the Widgetized sidebar into your site layout, which requires slight modifications of the theme. Thankfully, this task is not <a href="http://automattic.com/code/widgets/themes/" title="Automattic / Widgetizing Themes" target="_blank">terribly difficult</a> to accomplish. Stay tuned and I&#8217;ll keep you informed on my usage of this nifty new plugin.
