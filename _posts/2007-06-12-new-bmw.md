The &#8220;garage&#8221; of one Matthew A. Smith just grew by one vehicle.

For my birthday (and Christmas, and birthday after that), I bought myself a 1999 BMW 323i (no I&#8217;m not spoiled, I&#8217;m paying for this one by myself). Of course, the real reason for the purchase is the cost of gas versus the low gas mileage of the Jeep. However, don&#8217;t worry &#8211; **I&#8217;m not selling the Jeep**! It has found a new (temporary) home at my parents&#8217; house, until I have time to do a little much-needed maintenance.

I&#8217;ve had the BMW for a little over a week, and am quite pleased with it so far. I need to do a little maintenance on it, such as changing the oil and fixing a few small details. The performance is nice, the ride smooth, and the fuel consumption quite pleasing (I got 27mpg on the interstate last week, and around 22mpg in town).

As I delve further into this new project, I&#8217;ll keep everyone informed.
