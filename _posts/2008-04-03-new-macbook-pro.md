Yea, I know&#8230; I&#8217;ve converted to the dark side.

If you&#8217;d told me two years ago that I&#8217;d be owning a Mac sometime in the future, I&#8217;d have laughed. However, over the past two years, I&#8217;ve used various Apple products at the computer store and helped friends with their Apple computers. I have become quite a fan of the construction and design that goes into these products and I finally decided to add an Apple to my extensive stable of computers.

I purchased the new laptop yesterday afternoon and I&#8217;ve been extremely happy with it so far. It&#8217;s doing everything I want or need it to do and works flawlessly with my other Windows computers. And of course OSX has plenty of nifty eye candy.

If you&#8217;re wondering about the specs, it&#8217;s a 15.4&#8243; widescreen with a 2.5GHz Core2Duo processor, 250GB hard drive, 2GB ram (which I&#8217;ll probably upgrade to 4GB in the near future), with the nVidia 8600 GT 512MB graphics card and all the other shiny Mac goodness.

By the way, this computer is a graduation present from my grandfather.

**Thanks Granddad!!!**
