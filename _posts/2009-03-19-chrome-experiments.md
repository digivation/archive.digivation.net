<img class="right" title="Falling Balls" src="http://archive.digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/balls.jpg" alt="Falling Balls" width="262" height="246" />I&#8217;ve really been enjoying [Google Chrome][1], the web browser created by Google which features the &#8220;blazingly fast&#8221; V8 JavaScript engine. To show off the features of the JS engine, they&#8217;ve created a site called [Chrome Experiments][2] (via [Google Blog][3]). There&#8217;s some really cool stuff there (check out the [Browser Ball][4] demo), but I think my favorite is [Ball Pool][5]&#8230; it&#8217;s fun *and* it makes cool looking paterns! There&#8217;s also a few neat 3D demos.

I&#8217;d recommend checking them out, though you may need Google Chrome or a late version of Firefox or Safari to view them.
