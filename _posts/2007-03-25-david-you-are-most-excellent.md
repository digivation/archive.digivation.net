So, I randomly decided to head over to my friend [David Comeaux&#8217;s site][1] and check out his latest music&#8230; and I must say, I am quite pleased with the aural goodness hiding in the nooks and crannies! David&#8217;s latest song [Calendar][2], is an excellent example of his music. Over the years, David&#8217;s style has become more polished and matured, and I must say, I really like where it&#8217;s heading. Keep it up Dave!
