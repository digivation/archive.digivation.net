I decided to revive my old iPod mini, that&#8217;s right, I said mini. It&#8217;s blue. I did this because I decided to venture into the wide world of podcasts and found a wide range of entertaining episodes. I did have a little trouble, however, with browsing the podcast library. There seems to be no real effective way to do this, you either must know exactly the one you are looking for, or you must listen to one of the most popular selections. Perhaps it come with the territory of being a million years behind everyone else listening. I started with a few whose titles piqued my interest, so here is what I thought of them.

[Engadget][1] Podcast: Pretty good technology news. I am a dedicated reader of the [site][1], but the podcast seems to lack a bit of its sarcasm and humor. Peter Rojas and Ryan Block do, however, maintain an interesting conversation about the latest technological advances and releases (mostly having to do with gadgets). This podcast earns my recommendation.

Steve Jobs and Bill Gates at [D5][2]: A most excellent interview featuring both of these technology behemoths. It is just a one shot dea, no subscription, but it is definitely worth it. It is from the [All Things Digital][2] Conference. They talk about each others contributions to the industry and offer their insights on the future. A must listen (or watch, there is a video).

[Dave Ramsey Show][3]: You may be familiar with his popular talk radio show, well, this is it (without the commercials). If you don&#8217;t know about him already, his show features financial advice for struggling or otherwise individuals. You can bet on learning some interesting tidbits during the program and the people&#8217;s stories are usually entertaining. This is also a recommended podcast.

[Google][4] Developer Podcast: Well, they couldn&#8217;t all be good. This could only be interesting if you are actually a Google developer. I was expecting some discussion about new stuff Google is doing, advances they are making, and news about things they are, you know, developing&#8230;not the case. Only the programming elite (not me) can understand what these guys are talking about, let alone find it interesting. It was miserable. Don&#8217;t bother listening to it.

That&#8217;s the round-up. I have also downloaded &#8220;This Week in Tech&#8221; on a recommendation from a friend and also Harvard Business Review&#8217;s &#8220;IdeaCast&#8221; because it sounded interesting but have yet to listen to either. If you have any more suggestions, just let me know, so I too can enjoy.
