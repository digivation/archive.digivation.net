The rate of increase of storage space has increased drastically &#8211; after hovering below 3 GB for the past year or so, Gmail accounts now have 5000 MB and counting &#8211; rapidly. In the past two days, the amount of storage has risen by around 100 MB. I guess this will help now that we can send and receive 20MB file attachments!
