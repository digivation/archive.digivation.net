The weekend is two dreadful hours away. I can almost taste it (or maybe that&#8217;s the taste of the coffee I drank earlier). At any rate, it&#8217;s a three day weekend with a nice weather outlook (unlike the forecast forÂ last night&#8217;s trip to the fair, I think this one might just stick). I&#8217;m attending a five-year highschool reunion tonight, after which I will get to hang out with Matt for a little while. Tomorrow, I&#8217;m not exactly sure what&#8217;s going on, but I think a few friends and I are headed to Milledgeville to investigate the festivities. Sunday holds a trip to Six Flags for some classic adrenaline-junkie fun. Monday is still open.

Maybe on Monday I&#8217;ll have a few minutes to sit down and finish some other articles I&#8217;m working on.

Anyway, have a good weekend and enjoy your Columbus day (even if you have to work)!
