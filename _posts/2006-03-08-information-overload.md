So I&#8217;ve spent the better part of the afternoon surfing some of the high profile blogs out there, such as <a href="http://photomatt.net" target="_blank" title="Matthew Mullenweg's blog">PhotoMatt</a> and <a href="http://warpspire.com" target="_blank" title="Kyle Neathâ€™s blog">Warpspire</a>, in search of design inspiration. Of course these travels involved many side trips into other cool upcoming services. Some of the more wonderful ones out there include <a href="http://30boxes.com" target="_blank">30boxes</a> (calandaring) and <a href="http://upcoming.org" target="_blank">Upcoming.org</a> (event management) &#8211; and so many more! The web is finally moving into a huge social network, connecting people and ideas in ways never before dreamed of. Oh, I&#8217;m too excited.
