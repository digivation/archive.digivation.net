I&#8217;m investigating [K2][1].

What happened to creating my own design, you ask? Well, upon reviewing the long wishlist that I had formulated for my own theme, I happened to be browsing the K2 feature list and noticed that many things I wanted to accomplish with my theme are already implemented in K2! In addition to that, K2 is a very pretty theme right out of the box &#8211; but it is very flexible with additional styling. I have been very happy with the theme in my preliminary testing and I will soon begin work on some customizations to better suit digivation. Please check back soon for more beautiful goodness!
