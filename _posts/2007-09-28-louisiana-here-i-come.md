Oh yea, it&#8217;s on! I&#8217;m getting ready to head to Louisiana for fall break (next weekend). Which means I get to hang out with Dave and Des, tailgate at the LSU / Florida game, and eat tasty cajun food! I can&#8217;t wait! I&#8217;ll be sure and snap a few pictures (better ones than I got on the last trip) so you can share in my enjoyment.

Aren&#8217;t you jealous!
