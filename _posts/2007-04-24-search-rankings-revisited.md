Last summer I did a little investigation as to how well my website ranked on Google for various search terms (a little one sided, but Google is the biggest search engine). When I [first][1] did the study, I looked at several terms.

[Matthew Smith][2] ranked somewhere on page 7 (so between position 61 and 70), [Matthew A Smith][3] and [Matthew Aaron Smith][4] were nowhere to be found, and [digivation][5] landed a number one ranking.

I later [returned][6] to the results to see how my strategic keyword usage modified my rankings. To my surprise, [Matthew Smith][2] had risen to position forty, a gain of 30+ positions. Apparently I didn&#8217;t revisit any of the other search terms.

So now, almost a year later, I have decided to return once again to my little [SEO][7] tricks and see what sorts of improvements my original search terms have made. Here are the juicy details:

> [Matthew Smith][2] &#8211; now on page three, holding down a respectable #24[  
> Matthew A Smith][3] &#8211; umm&#8230; how&#8217;s #196. Thankfully, this is not the most important term  
> [Matthew Aaron Smith][4] &#8211; not even in the top 200. Never mind.  
> [digivation ][5]- well, I still dominate this search term. Guess that&#8217;s a sort of unique term, so maybe its not terribly fair.

I hope to someday be able to Google &#8220;Matthew Smith&#8221; and find my website in the top 10. A number one spot would be really cool, but to get that I&#8217;m gonna have to release something cool and get a bunch of link love. Either that or blog about myself a lot more&#8230; on a side note, [Dave][8] is lucky &#8211; he has the number one spot for &#8220;David Comeaux.&#8221; But in my defense, there are a lot more &#8220;Matthew Smiths&#8221; out there, and his name is in his url, which gives him several points in the search results.
