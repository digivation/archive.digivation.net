Just a quick word of congratulations to my friend David on his recent acceptance of a job offer! Dave is a very talented engineer and will be graduating from LSU in December. It seems he had one of the best problems imaginable, especially given the current economy: he had too many job offers! At any rate if you see him, be sure to congratulate him on his accomplishments!
