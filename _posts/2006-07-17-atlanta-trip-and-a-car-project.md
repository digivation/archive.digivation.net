To round out my hectic month of weekly trips throughout Georgia, I spent Saturday in Atlanta with Amy. For those of you who don&#8217;t know, she is one of my closest lady friends, and seeing her always brightens my day. Unfortunately, my trip to Atlanta was not quite as inspiring &#8211; about an hour into my trip, I attempted to avoid an accident on I-285. However, instead of simply bypassing the accident, I ended up meandering about North Atlanta for over an hour. Despite the minor driving setback, Amy and I had a wonderful time discussing any and everything, enjoying a delectable dinner at [Copelands][1], and visiting with a few of her Atlanta friends. I miss having Amy around, now that she&#8217;s graduated and assumed real responsibilities, but am truly excited for her &#8211; she has gotten her first real job as a teacher!

In other (unassociated) news, I am currently formulating preliminary plans to restore a <strike>1980</strike> 1981 Chevrolet Corvette belonging to my uncle. The car has been sitting in a garage for the several years after it was inherited from my grandfather. We will (hopefully and time permitting) perform a body-off restoration of the awesome piece of classic American machinery sometime in the next few months. After completion, I will have the pleasure of occasional trips in a V8 350 Ci sport car&#8230; which is quite enough motivation to expend hours toiling in a garage (not to mention I enjoy such things). I&#8217;ll keep everyone posted on the evolution of this project, which may well turn into one of the most exciting ones of the year!
