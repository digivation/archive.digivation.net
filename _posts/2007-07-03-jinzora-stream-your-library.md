I just ran across a neat looking piece of software called [Jinzora][1] which claims to allow you to browse and stream your media library over the web, for free. I&#8217;ve looked for something like this several times in the past, but never found anything that came with an open source license. Jinzora is GPL&#8217;d software, so you don&#8217;t lose anything by giving it a shot. I don&#8217;t have time to play with it right now, but drop by the site and give the demo a run.

Before you get to excited, I would have you know that it&#8217;s a PHP program and requires a web server. This being said, you can run a web server on your home computer for the purpose of streaming your media&#8230; though that&#8217;s a tad beyond the scope of this particular post. Maybe later&#8230;
