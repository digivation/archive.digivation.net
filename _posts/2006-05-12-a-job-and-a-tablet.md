Today I write to you from one intriguing new computing innovation to bring you astoundingly wonderful news: I have a new job! Today I received &#8220;the call&#8221; from Emerson informing me that the job is mine. I must simply complete the physical on Tuesday and I&#8217;m good to go; I could start as early as Monday the 22nd.

As for the computing innovation previously alluded too, I am composing this post from an amazing tablet PC by <a href="http://www.motioncomputing%20com/" target="_blank">Motion Computing</a>. The handwriting recognition is excellent, the screen is astounding, and the tablet is just plain fun to use. I highly recommend checking it out.

In final news, <a href="http://google.com/notebook" target="_blank" title="this link will work soon...">Google Notebook</a> was <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/05/yes-we-are-still-all-about-search.html" target="_blank">recently announced</a>. This handy new online tool will let you store notes, snippets, and other information about a website. You can this share this information with others or choose to keep it private. Who knows what&#8217;s next? I&#8217;m still waiting for Google&#8217;s answer to Yahoo&#8217;s purchase of flickr.

Unit next time, hang tight. Matthew, out!
