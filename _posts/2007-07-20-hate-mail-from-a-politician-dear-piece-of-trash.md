<a href="http://digivation.net/2007/07/20/hate-mail-from-a-politician-dear-piece-of-trash/drug-letter/" rel="attachment wp-att-357" title="Drug Letter"><img src="http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/drugletter.thumbnail.gif" alt="Drug Letter" align="right" /></a>This letter to a drug dealer, while being rather funny, leads me to question the mental stability of the writer, a certain Michael Polensek. Mr. Polensek happens to be a city councilman in Cleveland, Ohio. The letter reads as follows, though you can click the image to the left to read the original or you can find out more about it at [The Smoking Gun][1]. Yet another reason we don&#8217;t like politicians.

> Dear Mr. Winston:
> 
> As Councilman representing Cleveland&#8217;s 11th Ward, I have been notified once again that you have been arrested for dealing drugs in my ward, this time at the Convenient Food mart located at 18506 St Clair Avenue in the parking lot.
> 
> Mr. Winston, you have to be &#8220;dumber than mud.&#8221; Don&#8217;t you know that one of your so-called friends from the &#8217;8th-Avenue&#8221; gang ratted your stupid &#8220;ass&#8221; out that you were dealing drugs from the parking lot? They cut a deal. So much for your wonderful pals, you idiot. I am so glad that you are now 18 years of age, because no you are an adult and can no longer hide behind the juvenile court system, Mr. Quarterback, loser. Remember when you told me to &#8220;kiss your black ass&#8221; at R.J. Taylor Playground and that you were going to be an NFL Quarterback? Well, the NFL, despite perceptions, is &#8220;not for losers!&#8221;
> 
> In closing, I told you just recently to stay out of my neighborhood, you crack dealing piece of trash. Yet, you keep coming back because you think you are a big man. Well, real men go to school or to work every day and take care of their family, and not through illegal drug activity. You are a &#8220;thug&#8221; and you know what? There are only two places you will end up at the rate you are going &#8211; that is, prison or the nearest funeral home. Quite frankly, I don&#8217;t care which one you get to first as long as your dumb stupid ass is out of my neighborhood.
> 
> Have a wonderful life, Arsenio. I am sure you have made your mother real proud. Remember when I spoke to her one of the other times that you were arrested for assaulting a police officer on East 185th Street? Only a moron would do that. Your fate is totally in your own hands; which, is a scary thought.
> 
> Go to jail or the cemetery soon,
> 
> [signed]
> 
> Michael D. Polensek  
> Councilman, Ward 11

I wonder what Mr. Polensek would have to say to [Michael Vick][2]?
