[Sonex][1], a company that apparently builds small sport airplanes, has revealed that it will begin producing a nice two-seater model powered by batteries (of the [Lithium-Polymer][2] variety). You will only be able to enjoy 45 minutes of flying time, but the company is hoping to boost those stats by possibly introducing some [ethanol][3] powered components. The best part of the whole thing, though is, the plane is said to be &#8220;vastly less expensive than other things out there&#8221;. Now that&#8217;s what I like to hear, I always wanted a plane. Read the press release [here][4].
