I was so busy stuffing my face and working (at the computer store) that I forgot to post. Oh well &#8211; at least I remembered eventually, right?

Over the break, besides consuming unhealthy amounts of delicious food and working to get some cash (and pay off those speeding tickets), I managed to buy a bluetooth ear piece (so that I can appear to be talking to myself in public), watch Beowulf and Hitman (the new movies), and relax a bit.

So now its back to the grind. Two weeks of school, then finals. Here I come!
