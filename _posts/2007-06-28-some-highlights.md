Since we are working on preparing a few site upgrades, I went through every post on digivation to perform a little maintenance. In the process of tagging, spell checking, and executing other editorial duties, I noticed a few &#8220;oldies but goodies&#8221; from last year, and thus, I give you &#8220;Back in the Day&#8221;:

*   If you want to learn something, why not check out &#8220;[Why Telephones Use Negative 48 Volts DC][1],&#8221; a lengthy post highlighting a few things I learned last summer.
*   For all your recruitment needs, try &#8220;[Building an Effective Recruitment Strategy][2],&#8221; one of a few posts relating my experiences as ATO&#8217;s recruitment chair for the 2006-2007 school year. The &#8220;[ATO Alpha Zeta Recruitment Materials][3]&#8221; post goes quite nicely with this. Not surprisingly, these has been getting some hits as we near the recruitment season.
*   For a little light &#8220;motivational&#8221; reading, check out &#8220;[Apathy and Procrastination][4]&#8221; and &#8220;[That&#8217;s Why You Don&#8217;t Fsck Around][5].&#8221; Perhaps these will be eye-openers for someone besides myself.
*   To dance on the lighter side of life, give &#8220;[Hey Ma, I Failed Engrish &#8211; For the Twelfth Time!][6]&#8221; and &#8220;[Christian Nudists / Derriere Advertising][7]&#8221; a spin. You could also try out the new tagging system with a look at [humor][8].
*   Finally, I present you with two short pieces, &#8220;[Writer&#8217;s Block][9]&#8221; and &#8220;[Listening to Coffee While Drinking Jazz][10].&#8221; For some reason, I just enjoy the writing style on those two.

It&#8217;s always fun (for me, at least) to go back and read through old posts from time to time. Occasionally I&#8217;ll stumble across a forgotten literary gem, other times I&#8217;ll just laugh at how bad my writing was/is. And I&#8217;ll always come away with new ideas.
