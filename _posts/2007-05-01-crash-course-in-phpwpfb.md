I have decided it is time to dabble in a little PHP coding. Or get a little deeper than I have gone before. At any rate, I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s time for me to produce a WordPress plugin. To accomplish this feat, I must learn a bit of [PHP][1] syntax, the idiosyncrasies of the [WordPress ][2]API, and a little bit of the [Facebook][3] API. It&#8217;s time to see how beneficial my Java programming class really was.

**The Plan**

The current plan is to write a simple plugin for WordPress that will connect to Facebook and retrieve your status for display on your WordPress blog. Why? Well, the [Twitter][4] service has been in the buzz recently, and a WordPress plugin was released to allow you to display your Twitter status on your blog. However, Twitter does (as far as I can tell) nothing more than allow you to post a little status blurb &#8211; just like Facebook. However, Facebook has a vast network and many more features&#8230; so why create and use another service for only one small thing? Instead, I could just import my Facebook status into my blog and be done with it.

Maybe others will see the same. My new plugin will be called [Facebook Status for WordPress][5] and will be named wp-facebook-status. As my PHP programming skills get better, and assuming that I find the time, I may write more plugins to implement further Facebook features (and possibly release an integrated suite that allows you to import all sorts of information from Facebook). For now, I&#8217;m just going to get my toes wet.

Please, if you have any comments, suggestions, encouragements, critiques, or other information, leave a comment!
