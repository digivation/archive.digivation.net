As many of you may know, I (among many others) am not a fan of DRM, a technology commonly employed to remove users&#8217; fair use rights as related to digital media. In <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060313/wr_nm/media_france_copyrights_dc" target="_blank">recent news</a> [<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/03/13/french-law-could-break-itunes-microsoft-drm/" target="_blank">via</a>], the French (of all people) have proposed a new law that could potentially make it legal for users to circumvent DRM &#8211; direct opposition to the DMCA laws in the USA. I must say, I&#8217;m impressed.
