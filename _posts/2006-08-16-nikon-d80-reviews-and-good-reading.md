Some may remember a [recent posting][1] about the new Sony DSLR-A100 (aka Minolta) camera that I almost purchased. I managed to wait around and see what Nikon had waiting in the wings (after their [annoying little teaser][2]) and from the look of things it will be worth the wait. According to various sources, the D80 (while sharing the same/similar 10MP sensor as the Sony) has [much better high-ISO noise response][3], better features, faster [sync speed][4], and the backlog of nice Nikon lenses. And that little SD card caveat isn&#8217;t that big of a deal in light of current prices.

I initially read some material at [DPReview][5], but then strayed over to [Ken Rockwell&#8217;s site][6], where I have become fascinated by his large body of practical advice on camera selection and photography tips. Highly recommended and a great help for putting things into perspective.

Reviews (that I&#8217;ve been reading) are at [DPReview][7] and [KenRockwell.com][8] (though Ken&#8217;s site is not as flashy, there is a ton of great info there. I have highlighted a few articles below, but I highly recommend sticking around and reading what he has to say.)

Other recommended reading material for those interested (from Ken Rockwell):

*   [Why Your Camera Does Not Matter][9]
*   [How to Make Great Photographs][10]
*   [Sony A100][11]
*   [Adding Dynamic Range to Any Camera][12]
*   [Film vs. Digital][13]
