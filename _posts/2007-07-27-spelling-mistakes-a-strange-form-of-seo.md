About a week ago, I wrote a [brief note][1] on a new viral advertisement for the new [Simpsons Movie][2] (which premieres today). This website, called &#8220;[Simpsonize Me][3],&#8221; allows users to create a Simpsons-esque likeness of themselves by uploading a photograph and tweaking some settings.

The post itself was (and is) of no real significance; however, I did make the mistake (in my haste) of accidentally writing &#8220;Simsonize Me&#8221; in the body of the post. This turned out to be one of the best misspellings I&#8217;ve ever made, resulting in a relatively large amount of search engine traffic from all those people with slight spelling deficiencies. I believe that we have seen an extra four or five hundred visitors because of that one simple mistake. Intriguing&#8230;
