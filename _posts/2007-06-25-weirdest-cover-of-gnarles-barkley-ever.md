Check out this really weird, yet oddly cool music video / cover of Gnarls Barkley&#8217;s song &#8220;[Crazy][1],&#8221; as performed on a [Theremin][2] (and other electronic instruments) by [The Ether and Aether Experiment][3].

Haunting sound, fascinating to watch! A Theremin is an electronic instrument controlled solely by the capacitance of your body; the musician doesn&#8217;t (normally) touch the instrument while playing, but instead moves his/her hands around two antennas which detect changes in the electromagnetic field surrounding them. Ooooo good nerdy fun!
