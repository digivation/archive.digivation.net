In an interesting new &#8220;working essay&#8221; written recently by researcher [danah boyd][1] titled &#8220;[Viewing American Class Divisions through Facebook and MySpace][2],&#8221; [MySpace][3] and [Facebook][4] are analyzed in light of the socio-economic (look at me, using big words and stuff) roles that they are playing. Facebook appears to be the choice of most &#8220;goodie two shoes, jocks, athletes, [and] other &#8220;good&#8221; kids,&#8221; while MySpace is increasingly the choice of most &#8220;Latino/Hispanic teens, immigrant teens, &#8216;burnouts, &#8216;alternative kids,&#8217; &#8216;art fags,&#8217; punks, emos, goths, gangstas, queer kids, and other kids who didn&#8217;t play into the dominant high school popularity paradigm.&#8221;

The study is more focused around the trends created by Highschoolers and less the &#8220;College&#8221; age (whom originally populated Facebook). It provides a very interesting portrait of how classes play out in America (the &#8220;working class&#8221; vs the &#8220;upper class&#8221;), even extending its observations to the Military (it appears that most soldiers use MySpace, while the officers use Facebook). A few possible reasons for the divide are given, and overall is an interesting look at the evolution of social networks and their effect on teen life.

I must say, from my personal experience as a member of both sites (but extremely inactive on MySpace), the essay does have many points that ring very true. Read it for yourself and form your own opinion &#8211; and don&#8217;t hesitate to comment!
