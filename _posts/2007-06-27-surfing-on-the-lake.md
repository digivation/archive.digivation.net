I don&#8217;t know if any of you are into water sports, and even if you are, you are less likely to have seen someone surfing on the lake. However, along with wakeboarding, this is one of the activities that my roommate and I engage in from time to time. While I was unable to go on this particular outing (because I was stuck at work all day), Eric (the afore-mentioned roommate) just sent me a few pictures I&#8217;d like to share.
