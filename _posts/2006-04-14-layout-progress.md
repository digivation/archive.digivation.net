Contrary to popular opinion, I have not yet forgotten, given up on, or otherwise abandoned my dreams of creating a custom digivation template to adorn these lonely posts. Indeed, I&#8217;m actually working on it today (seeing as how I actually have a little free time for the first time in weeks). Hang around for updates; I&#8217;m currently sketching my idea.

**Update 4:22PM**: I have some preliminary artwork in Illustrator&#8230; We&#8217;ll see where this goes&#8230;

**Update 5.18.06**: Nothing is getting done right now because of school. Here is a preview of my current train of thought. Subject to great change, as usual.
