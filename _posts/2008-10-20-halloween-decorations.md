We&#8217;ve decorated headquaters for Halloween. It&#8217;s about as ghetto as it gets, but it&#8217;s all in good fun.

Apparently we&#8217;ve disturbed a few neighbors, some of whom thought that it says &#8220;ho&#8221; as in &#8220;whore.&#8221; Not to fear, that&#8217;s a Q.

Watch it in HD [here][1]. This is my first edit with Final Cut Pro (thanks [Dave][2], it&#8217;s cool software), I think it came out ok. Let me know what you think!
