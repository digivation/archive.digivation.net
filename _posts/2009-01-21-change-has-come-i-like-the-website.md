Always the optimist, I feel that changes are quite needed and I&#8217;m always seeing the best in the opportunity.

To reflect the change in regime, President Obama&#8217;s crack web team has put up a brand new site at [Whitehouse.gov][1], and I must say, I like it quite a lot! It has a very modern, up to date feel and seems easy to navigate. I wish I knew more about the backend, but a (very) cursory glance at the source didn&#8217;t shed any light (I&#8217;m assuming it is a custom coded backend).

Kottke has a most revealing glance at the [change inÂ Whitehouse.gov/robots.txt][2], which is what prompted my first glance at the site.

Hurray for change&#8230; here&#8217;s to the future!
