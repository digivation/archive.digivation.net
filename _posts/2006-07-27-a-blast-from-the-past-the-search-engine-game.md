I was recently surfing the web, when, for no reason at all, I wondered if I could find a copy of my very first website. Over the years, I have been through numerous sites, designs, platforms, topics, you name it, I&#8217;ve probably tried it. In fact, I can&#8217;t even remember all the places that I stuffed web pages &#8211; trust me, I tried. I do, however, remember the very first site that I produced, way back around 1997, not too long after I got online (which was sometime in 1996). This rudimentary site was hosted with AT&T&#8217;s personal web site service &#8211; I even remember the [URL][1] (it&#8217;s long gone) and lovingly crafted with Notepad.

I wondered if there might happen to be any web archives of my old site (you know, for posterity&#8217;s sake), and upon typing the URL into Google, promptly ran across this entry in someone&#8217;s **[guest book][2]** (remember those, back before we all had blogs and comments?).

It is very good to see HI quality apps for free. I was wondering if there is any way to mack paquet builder add icons to start menu ? Also, what about the site ratings that don&#8217;t belong here ?(makes message that the rating for this site belongs to somewhere else) Great job ! Matthew Smith [removed link and missing image]

Amazing &#8211; I have no clue what I&#8217;m talking about (it was the guest book for some [software programmer][3]), I sound retarded, and, wait &#8211; was that posted at lunch time on a SCHOOL DAY? Yes, it was &#8211; that&#8217;s the joy of home schooling!

At any rate, I hereby challenge **you** (assuming you&#8217;re not completely new to this whole &#8220;internet&#8221; fad) to hit Google or your favorite search engine and see what bits and bytes you can dig up on yourself. Hey, its fun &#8211; and you never know what you might find! If it&#8217;s interesting, I&#8217;d love to know &#8211; leave a comment or trackback from your blog entry!
