Today marks my own personal &#8220;hell day.&#8221; It seems that everything is due today &#8211; test corrections, homework problems, and a nice long feasibility report. To make matters worse, I put everything off until yesterday. I will blame this partially on the fact that I worked all day Saturday and had chapter for nine hours on Sunday. Despite getting only four hours of sleep last night, I am excited &#8211; why? Because I&#8217;m almost DONE. That&#8217;s right, after today its smooth sailing clear to Friday. What is Friday? Well, my friend, the **Friday is the first day of spring break**!

Unfortunately, it would appear that at the current moment I will be spending the week in good ole&#8217; Macon, just as I have done every other spring break, working to fund the rest of the semester. Whatever. I work 9am &#8211; 6pm so my evenings are free. If you&#8217;re around, give me a call and we&#8217;ll hang out.
