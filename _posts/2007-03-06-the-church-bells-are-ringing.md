Its getting to be that time of year again, the time when flowers bloom, the grass turns green, and&#8230; my friends get married. The hitchings include (there were so many I had to make a list), but are not limited too:

*   Kenneth and Christina
*   David and Desiree
*   Will and Renee
*   Chris and Amanda
*   Justin and Nicole
*   Adam and Katie
*   Corbin and Melissa

Here are brief dialogs for each couple, in no particular order:

**Kenneth and Christina**

I&#8217;ve known Kenneth since 8th grade. Along with Eric and I, the three musketeers of middle school and are continuing the tradition with a wedding. Of course this will mark the end of our career as the three musketeers. Kenneth and Christina have been inseparable for almost as long as I can remember (well, since senior year of high school). I know that these two will make a wonderful couple and wish them the best of luck in life. I am already envisioning having the yearly BBQ at their house. That will also be the only time of year when I see Kenneth&#8230;

[**David and Desiree**][1]

David holds a special place in my heart as one of my early college friends (remember the good old days of Calc II lab?) and my fraternal big brother (even though we&#8217;re the same age). When I think of Dave and Des, I remember all those days in the gym, the long talks, and all the laughs. I remember the look in Dave&#8217;s eye when he talked about Des, and I remember those reasons with which he packed up and followed her to LSU. Last summer, on a perfectly innocent blue-sky day, I received a breathless call from Dave informing me that he and Des were engaged and that he would be honored if I would be a groomsman. That was one of the most excited calls I&#8217;ve ever received and this will be the most worthwhile <strike>700</strike> 1400 mile trip I&#8217;ve ever made.

**Will and Renee**

William is a fellow engineer (double-E if you must know) and loyal fraternity brother. Many a wonderful night have been had with Will studying, partying, thinking, and sitting in chapter. These days, Will studies hard (it has paid off) and visits his special someone in the ATL. When not engaged in one of these two activities, Will is generally sociable and hangs out with us whenever possible. While I&#8217;m not in this wedding, I most definitely will be in attendance. Who knows, it might just be the last time I see Will (I&#8217;m *just kidding*)!

**Chris and Amanda**

Chris is one of the older fraternity brothers who graduated right after I became a brother. While I didn&#8217;t have a chance to become the best of friends with him, Chris was one of the brothers whom I respected and looked up too. He also happens to be in my fraternal &#8220;family,&#8221; and I believe he was once a holder of the &#8220;Coolwhip&#8221; jersey. But you wouldn&#8217;t know anything about that now, would you? As for Amanda, she is a sweet and wonderful lady. At any rate, this will be a miraculous wedding and one that I have to miss (due to work and the long drive). I&#8217;m sure things will go fine without me, but I&#8217;ll be thinking of the both of you!

**Justin and Nicole**

Before last summer, Justin was nothing more than an ATO alumnus with an appetite for fun. Then, in late May (after discovering that I was living in Columbus for the summer) I received that fateful call inviting me to &#8220;come hang out.&#8221; My life has never been dull since that moment! Justin is a great brother, amazing friend, and just plain cool guy in general (Nichole is equally awesome). The monotony of summer was repeatedly shattered by Justin&#8217;s calls to &#8220;chill&#8221; at the lake or &#8220;hang out&#8221; with Nichole&#8217;s family (who is also awesome). Needless to say, this is going to be one awesome wedding/marriage/life/yes. Hopefully I will see Mr. and Mrs. Justin on a monthly, if not weekly basis (ha ha just kidding, I&#8217;m not moving into your basement). And yes, I&#8217;ll be at this wedding despite it being so close to Christmas you can smell the torn gift wrapping.

**Adam and Katie**

These two cool cats are some of the most recent engage-ets on this list. Congratulations are in order (though I&#8217;ve known that thoughts of engagement and marriage have been floating through Adam&#8217;s head for some time now) for this wonderful couple. I have yet to receive the details for this wedding, but I will most likely be in attendance. Either way, I wish you both the best!

**Corbin and Melissa**

Corbin and Melissa&#8230; are some of my favorite &#8220;old people.&#8221; A way-back-when president of ATO and generally fun-lovin&#8217; sort of guy, Corbin will always hold a special place in my world view, and because Ms. Melissa is cool enough to be Mrs. Corbin she&#8217;s certainly cool enough for me! Other than general interactions on occasions, I haven&#8217;t had much chance to get to know these too all that well, but I&#8217;ll try to attend this wedding, time and distance permitting.

The craziest part is that this list is far from complete! However, I seem to have forgotten exactly what other weddings I shall be attending (or think about attending) this summer. It&#8217;s always startling to sit back and think about all the friends who are fixing to get their Mr/Mrs on, but I wish the best of luck to all of you!
