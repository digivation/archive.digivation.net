It would seem that lunch break serves as a playground for mental stimulation. Revelation of the day: I can use the voice memo feature of my phone to hash out new ideas on the run, then return to my desk in the evening to editorialize them here. I don&#8217;t know why I didn&#8217;t think of this before and I&#8217;m sure someone else has <strike>thought of</strike> done this already; despite these setbacks, I will attempt to employ this concept ASAP. Why &#8220;lifeblog?&#8221; Well its simple, really. I always have some commentary that pops into my head throughout the day (usually related to some life occurance) but by the time I am able to share my thought with you, its already vanished into a haze of misfired neurons. Problem Solved &#8211; hang on tight!
