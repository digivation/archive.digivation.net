And that makes me happy to note that while surfing the &#8216;net I ran across a new NIN remix CD, [Y34RZ3R0R3M1X3D][1] (Year Zero Remixed). The album itself is actually quite enjoyable, but the most fantastic part of the deal is found at the bottom of the page:

> Incudes CD with same track listing as digital download (see above). **Also includes a DVD ROM (not a movie) that contains every track from Year Zero in multitrack format for you to do with what you please.** Mac or PC.
> 
> We&#8217;ve included:  
> Pre-formatted for Apple GarageBand  
> Pre-formatted for Ableton Live (Mac or PC)  
> Demo version of Ableton Live (Mac or PC)  
> Generic WAVE files at 16 bit 44K that can be loaded into any audio editor
> 
> Soon you will be able to share your custom remixes online, and listen to others, at **[remix.nin.com][2]**.

I love that bands are embracing their fans in such fantastic ways (**[see also][3]** the new Radiohead CD, [In Rainbows][4]). Sure, the music industry is light years behind on almost everything, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the bands are as well. Bravo to those who stand up.

It&#8217;s also worthy to note that this is not the first time that NIN has done something like this (they have released multi-track masters to the public for a <strike>couple</strike> [several][5] songs), but I&#8217;m <strike>pretty sure this is the first time anything of this magnitude has been done</strike> perhaps not, see previous link&#8230;

Let the creation begin! **And thank you NIN**!
