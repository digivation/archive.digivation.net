As some dedicated readers may recall, I work at a local computer store from time to time, usually in a sales/customer service capacity. You may also recall that I live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macon%2C_Georgia#Demographics" target="_blank" title="wikipedia on Macon, GA">Macon with its fabulously ghetto population</a> in eternal tango with the wealthy few that live dispersed around the city.  
And, as with many other funny stories, the ghetto-ness will occasionally rear its head and vomit up a funny story. Today&#8217;s tale actually involves a letter (ahem, **Business **Letter) recently received from what appears to be a local accounting firm. I think the following needs no explanation. Please be aware that this is taken **directly **from the letter. I only wish I could disclose the origins of said letter&#8230;

I am without words.
