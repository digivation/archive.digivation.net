[Time online][1] has generated a short list (very short) of the [worst sites][2] infiltrating our beloved Interweb. I would have to greatly agree with the evaluation of these journalists as most of these sites just plain annoy me. The list is as follows:

[eHarmony.com][3] &#8211; After completing your 426 question survey and paying your monthly premium, you can still possibly be rejected as &#8220;unmatchable&#8221;.

[Evite.com][4] &#8211; Have you ever gotten one of these? Not worth the time/effort. Good idea gone terribly wrong, use facebook.

[Meez.com][5] &#8211; Never heard of it. Apparently a service to trash up your e-mail (and take up too much space in inboxes) .

[MySpace.com][6] &#8211; Agreed. Justice.

[SecondLife.com][7] &#8211; Live a second life online, if you can spend a few hours figuring it out, and then enough time to lead another life (slow loading times included).

Now, they have also composed another list of &#8220;[25 Sites We Can&#8217;t Live Without][8]&#8221; which contains several of my regular visits including [ESPN.com][9], [Amazon.com][10], [Ebay.com][11], [Google.com][12], and [HowStuffWorks.com][13], among others. Check out the lists, which sites do you think are the worst? Which can&#8217;t you live without?
