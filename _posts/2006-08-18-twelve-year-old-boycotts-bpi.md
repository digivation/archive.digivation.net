The world needs more determined artists like young Amy Thomas. Miss Thomas is protesting against the British Phonographic Industry, the British version of our very own RIAA. The reason? The BPI has decided not to include her latest single in their charts because because of her stance on file sharing! Bravo! Success in the digital age will come to people like Amy who explore new ways of doing things, not organizations like the RIAA and the MPAA who are trying their best to slow technological advances and maintain a grip on their outdated model.

Amy&#8217;s upcoming kid&#8217;s single, Just Smile, should be out shortly. [[link][1] - via [here][2] and [here][3]]
