I&#8217;m back from a wild weekend of driving through Georgia, [getting brothers married][1], and celebrating with friends &#8211; maybe a post on that topic is in order. For now, a quick test post of Zooomr, a (relatively) new photo sharing upstart. They seem to be offering free Pro accounts to bloggers, so I guess I&#8217;ll take advantage of that (I&#8217;ve been a member for a few months) [[via][2] - [more info][3]].
