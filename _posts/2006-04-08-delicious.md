I know I&#8217;m a little behind the times. Maybe I&#8217;m a bit hard-headed at times, or a little over &#8220;I can do it MY way.&#8221; I&#8217;ve known about del.icio.us since sometime near its inception but simply refused to use it. Fine fine, take it easy &#8211; I&#8217;ve finally converted, seeing as how my extensive collection of online bookmarks vanished into cyberspace with the [rest of my website][1]. I am now in the process of populating my bookmarks page; if you happen to dig things like that, you can <a href="http://del.icio.us/matthew.smith" target="_blank" title="matthew's del.icio.us">find me here</a>. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll run across more nifty uses for del.icios.us soon.

**Update:** if anyone reading this uses del.icio.us, I&#8217;d love to add your username to my <a href="http://del.icio.us/inbox/matthew.smith" target="_blank" title="del.icio.us inbox">inbox</a>. Just leave a comment to this post.
