Normal People do their resolutions before the beginning of the new year. I do mine much later. Without further ado:

I, Matthew A. Smith, in the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">nineth</span> tenth year of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">second</span> third millenium, hereby resolve to:

1.  Travel to at least 50 places I&#8217;ve never been before
2.  Get in the best shape of my life
3.  Look for adventure in the mundane
4.  Drink less alcohol
5.  Eat better
6.  Save $15,000
7.  Redesign my website, and actually roll out a complete site on time
8.  Create more videos
9.  Take more pictures
10. Post content regularly, and of greater variety (see also, number 7)

Now, let&#8217;s see if I can pull this off&#8230; What about you?

<small>2000 would be the first year of the third millenium, correct&#8230; I originally had 1008?</small>
