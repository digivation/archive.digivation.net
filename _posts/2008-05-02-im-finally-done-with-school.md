However, I&#8217;m feeling a little melancholic for I have finished the last final of my undergraduate career. Five years of college, four years of high school, two years of middle school, and six years of grade school&#8230; I&#8217;ve only known school, and now that chapter of my life is done. It&#8217;s time to move on to new things, see new places, and meet new people  (but of course I&#8217;ll miss the ones I leave behind). Here&#8217;s two little lists that should sum it up.

Reasons I&#8217;m Sad

*   No more staying up until 3AM
*   No more sleeping &#8217;til 12PM
*   No more all night parties
*   I have to pay bills

Reasons I&#8217;m Happy

*   No more finals or exams
*   No more school loans
*   <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">No more drama</span> (who am I kidding)

Anyway, I&#8217;ll be around Macon (and the rest of Georgia) next year. I have accepted a job at RAFB doing some sort of engineering work and I&#8217;ll be living with another ATO alumnus who is buying a new house about ten minutes from campus. The party shall continue (but only on the weekends)!

On another note, I&#8217;m going to be around Macon from now until I start my job at the end of June (aside from a couple weeks of vacation), so be sure and look me up. I want to hang out and enjoy my last few weeks of freedom!
