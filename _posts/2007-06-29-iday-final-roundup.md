People are [going crazy][5]. Doing [silly things][6]. [Painting pictures][7], [baking cakes][8]&#8230; Steve even [gave away $12 million][9] (yes, million) worth of iPhone goodness to his dedicated Apple employees (talk about benefits). What ever has the word come to?

At least one person still has their head on straight. Ed Felten (author of the excellent blog [Freedom to Tinker][10] and a Princeton professor) has written [a level-headed and thoughtful article][11] on the whole iPhone ordeal and why it will change the world, even if the iPhone isn&#8217;t that revolutionary by itself.

> The real significance of the iPhone, whether it succeeds or fails in the market, is that it will trigger the transition to more open networks. Once people see that a pretty good phone can be a pretty good mobile computer, they wonâ€™t settle for less anymore; and mobile networks will be pried open.Whether or not the Jesus Phone achieves worldly success, it will succeed in its own way by convincing people that the world can be different.

If you&#8217;re still trying to figure out where you can acquire such a revolutionary device, here&#8217;s a handy [Google maps mash-up][12]. Then get ready, &#8217;cause 6PM is just around the corner!

PS. You won&#8217;t find me at the AT&T store at 6PM. No sir, sorry, not gonna happen. However, I *would* take an iPhone if you give it to me&#8230;.
