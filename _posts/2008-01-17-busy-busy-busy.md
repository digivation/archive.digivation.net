<a href="http://archive.digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/matthew.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="Matthew Smith"><img src="http://archive.digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/matthew.thumbnail.jpg" class="left" alt="Matthew Smith" /></a>This has been a busy but great week. I&#8217;ll be back with more detail on some of these events, but I gave a presentation last night (which went really well, and the video and other information will be online soon), helped a friend assemble a new computer today, I&#8217;ve been in the gym three days this week (and tomorrow will be the fourth &#8211; getting back into shape), I&#8217;ve done a little homework (love only taking 12 hours of class), and I&#8217;ve been working a few hours a day to boot!

Speaking of work, I&#8217;ve been developing some Windows scripts to help with system administration. They may be simple but I think that they are **super-cool**! I&#8217;ve been learning to work with [WMI][1] through [JScript][2] (not because I love [WSH][3] or JScript or anything, but it&#8217;s built into all the machines I manage and JScript looks more like the languages I&#8217;m familiar with than [VBScript][4]&#8230; read [this][5] for some other reasons) and it allows me to do some really cool things. The coolest part is that these functions **can be executed against either a local machine or a *remote machine***&#8230; which means I could write some scripts that scan the network and create reports of certain configuration settings on all the machines that are found. I&#8217;ll be writing more on this later, and probably create a site section dedicated to these code snippets I&#8217;ve been creating (they are reusable and can be inserted into many scripts).

### Ps, Thank You Kenneth

If you don&#8217;t know, **I love receiving comments** on my posts (and I reply to them) because it reminds me that **people actually read this stuff**! It&#8217;s fun to have a little dialog on the website from time to time&#8230; so if you&#8217;re feeling game, don&#8217;t hesitate to drop a line &#8211; even if it&#8217;s just to say hi!
