With such a long and auspicious title, this post has a lot to live up to; therefore, let us begin! First things first &#8211; why would you actually want to claim your Flickr pages on Technorati? I have no idea (but I&#8217;m going to find out), other than putting another link on the &#8220;blogs you claim&#8221; page of your Technorati account and seeing how many sites link to your photostream. Now that we have this behind us, let&#8217;s begin.

1.  Login to your [Technorati][1] account. If you don&#8217;t have one, well then, duh &#8211; create a new one.
2.  Click the &#8220;Blogs&#8221; link at the top of the page.
3.  Enter your [Flickr][2] address (the address you get when you click on &#8220;Your Photos&#8221; on Flickr, something like http://flickr.com/photos/[your ID or name]/) into the &#8220;Claim a Blog&#8221; box and hit &#8220;Begin Claim.&#8221;
4.  Click &#8220;skip this step&#8221; on the Technorati Embed page.
5.  Copy HTML code on the Technorati Link page.
6.  Past the code into the description field of one of your photos that appears on that page, or enter it in the description of a new photo. We will remove this link after completing the process.
7.  Back on Technorati, click &#8220;Claim this Blog&#8221; and follow the directions.
8.  Remove the code from your photo description.

Congratulations, your &#8220;personal esteem&#8221; points just went up. You will feel better, look better, smell better, and generally be a happier person now. Trust me, I did it&#8230; check out my [Technorati Profile][3]. Another pointless idea risen from the ashes of bordom!
