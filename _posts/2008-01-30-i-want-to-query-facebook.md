Facebook offers a developer API that allows programmers to use the data stored by Facebook. One of the neat features is called &#8220;Facebook Query Language,&#8221; and allows you to execute queries on the data provided by Facebook, as if it were a giant database (oh, wait, it is). Earlier this afternoon I was wishing I could gather a list of all my friends and their website URLs (if any). Since many of my friends are on Facebook, I figured that Facebook would be a great place to start. But who wants to click through 600+ Facebook profiles copying down website addresses??? Not I &#8230; but that does sound like a great task for your average computer program, right?

Since the normal Facebook interface does not allow you to perform &#8220;report&#8221; style searches on your friend list, I jumped over to the [developer docs][1]. Sure enough, the query language can retrieve all sorts of cool information through the API &#8211; **but not a friend&#8217;s website**! In fact, no contact information is available through the API (I&#8217;m assuming this is for security purposes). Unfortunately this means that my nifty idea is moot&#8230; no automatically updating phone book, list of friend urls, etc is possible.

I&#8217;m sad.
