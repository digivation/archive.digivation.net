<img src="http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/badge_poster.thumbnail.png" alt="Badge (Poster)" class="right" />Today marked the first of four days of Spring recruitment for the <a href="http://www.atoaz.com" title="ATO AZ Chapter, Mercer University" target="_blank">Alpha Zeta chapter</a> of ATO. This year has turned out quite promising for our chapter, with sixteen fall pledges and three current spring pledges. Over the course of our recruitment period, we hope to gain a few more pledges out of the many excellent men whom we are currently getting to know.

Tonight&#8217;s activities centered around the excellent live music provided by the &#8220;Alpha Zeta Standard,&#8221; a jazz band consisting of several brothers and pledges. The music was exquisite and provided an excellent background to chat with the perspective gentlement present. We were also priviledged with the company of many fine ladies, both greek and non-greek who came around to socialize, enjoy the music, and meet the recruits.

Hopefully the remaining days will continue to be a smashing success and at the end of the week I can report a record number of spring pledges &#8211; a sure sign of strong brotherhood and a thriving chapter.
