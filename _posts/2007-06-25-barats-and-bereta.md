If you&#8217;re not familiar with their work, [Barats and Bereta][3] make some hilarious video sketches, and you should certainly hop on over to their [website][3] and check out their stuff. Start out with a good look at &#8220;Mothers Day,&#8221; &#8220;PC Frat Boys, and perhaps &#8220;Completely Uncalled For.&#8221;

Thanks to [Dave][4] for introducing me to these guys!

P.S. You can friend [me][5], too <img src="http://digivation.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
