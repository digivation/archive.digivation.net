  Dear Readers,
  
  If you attempted to visit my site during the past few weeks, things have been a little broken. First, the server was completely unaccessible, then, instead of the familiar yellow pages and witty banter that graced the old digivation.net, visitors were greeted with an ugly blue page declaring "site not defined." Apparently some friendly neighborhood hackers felt so led as to attack the server hosting my site and delete all of the accounts contained therein. Thankfully, my equally friendly hosting company got my account back up and running ASAP, but it would seem that all backups are lost.

Dear Readers,

If you attempted to visit my site during the past few weeks, things have been a little broken. First, the server was completely unaccessible, then, instead of the familiar yellow pages and witty banter that graced the old digivation.net, visitors were greeted with an ugly blue page declaring &#8220;site not defined.&#8221; Apparently some friendly neighborhood hackers felt so led as to attack the server hosting my site and delete all of the accounts contained therein. Thankfully, my equally friendly hosting company got my account back up and running ASAP, but it would seem that all backups are lost.

As you can see, the site is rather different (besides the fact that there isn&#8217;t anything here). I am giving <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="WordPress" target="_blank">WordPress</a> a spin after hearing rave reviews from friends, taking a break from Serendipity, my previous blog script. Unfortunately, my custom theme is lost, along with all the past posts. I will be working on a site redesign over the next few weeks, but in the mean time I will be posting on as regular a basis as possible. Thanks for your understanding!
