We&#8217;ll be playing a smooth blend of rock, rap, old(ish) stuff, and whatever else pleases our auditory palette.

It should go down like a smooth vodka on the rocks (some may argue that it&#8217;s &#8220;Mr. B&#8217;s&#8221; on the rocks, but whatever).

We&#8217;ll be experimenting with our &#8220;sound&#8221; (when are we not?) and hopefully trying out some new visual stuff. If everything works out as planned, we&#8217;ll have some audio posted up here later on for your listening pleasure. We plan on starting the evening off with some chill stuff, playing around a bit and just having a good time. As the night progresses, we&#8217;ll probably move more toward rap and bigger beats to keep the party moving (or so we hope).

Anyway, we&#8217;d love it if you came out and chilled with us. We&#8217;ll be out there from 10pm-2am and the cover is $3, but if you arrive before 11:30 armed with [this flyer][1] (just print it) you will get in for free.
