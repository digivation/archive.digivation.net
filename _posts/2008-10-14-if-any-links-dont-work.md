If you are browsing the site and find a link that is broken, be sure and let me know (just leave a comment) and I will attempt to rectify the issue. Over the past few days I came under a little scrutiny from my webhosting provider to remove some media content (mostly streaming MP3s) from the server. I have performed the cleanup (and am now contemplating a move to a [new hosting provider][1]), but there may be some broken links around the site. Let me know and I&#8217;ll get right on it.

Also, if you have recommendations for other shared hosting providers that are reasonably priced, please let me know!
