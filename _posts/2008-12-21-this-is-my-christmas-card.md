[Merry Christmas from the Guys of the hQ][1] from [Matthew Smith][2] on [Vimeo][3].

Merry Christmas everyone! This is our video Christmas card, and hopefully it will bring you a smile and maybe a little laughter this holiday season. You can [click through][1] to Vimeo if you would like to watch the high-def version.

### The Making Of

WhenÂ my roommates and I originally decided to do a Christmas card, we were planning on sending out a normal paper card, adorned with a picture of the three of us in a rather cheesy typical Christmas pose. We hauled out the camera and tripod and proceded to configure and light our scene. During this process, I happened to take a number of test shots to get the lighting right. When we sat down to review the pictures, my infamous &#8220;iTunes library on shuffle&#8221; just so happened to play &#8220;Kiss&#8221; by Prince &#8230; and the rest is history.

All the shots were arranged in Premiere and the titles were created in After Effects. My video skillz are improving, though I&#8217;m not sure how we&#8217;re gonna top this next year&#8230;

I&#8217;ll add details if anyone is interested, but for now I just wanna get this out there! Enjoy!
