I found something for Ben, Andrew, Michael, Dave, and all the other guys that like soccer.

Maybe even those who don&#8217;t. Apparently these are from GQ, though I&#8217;m not sure if they are advertisements or just cool pictures&#8230;

Not only did I snag these from [Scaryideas][1], but this is a little trial of the [photo gallery][2] (currently unfinished). Click the pictures to view the full size image and find a few more on the [same topic][3].
