Hello everyone, I turn 21 on Sunday. I just thought I&#8217;d write that down for everyone&#8217;s benefit. What will I be doing on Sunday, you ask (cause, you know, the bars and stuff will be closed)?

On Sunday, my family will be heading to Hilton Head for a week-long vacation &#8211; without me. I shall be staying here (I&#8217;m not asking for vacation time one week into a new job) entertaining myself in &#8220;other&#8221; ways. As fate would have it, an Alumnus of my fraternity (ATO, if you missed that) will be in Columbus for the weekend and has invited me over to celebrate. We&#8217;re gonna hang out, hit the lake, chill with the ladies, and cause a general ruckus.

So, despite missing out on the family vacation for my birthday, I am content with the following developments (which I will henceforth consider my collective &#8220;birthday present&#8221;):

1.  I have a real engineering job, doing real engineering stuff (and getting paid real engineering money)
2.  I will attend at least three parties to celebrate my birthday
3.  I get to spend my birthday on the lake
4.  See #3, with the addition of beautiful women
5.  See #3 & 4, with the addition of wakeboarding
6.  (undisclosed)

Yep, I&#8217;m pretty excited about my 21st birthday. Ya&#8217;ll be safe now, hear?
