Therefore, in the spirit of networking and the internet, I want to read more of your blogs &#8211; my reading list is full of tech news and other interesting things but seriously lacking in the &#8220;people I know&#8221; department. Thus, I propose this:

**Send us the URL to your blog. A comment to this post is all that we ask.** I will read your blog. If I know you, that is much better (I like to read about all sorts of people but I really love reading stuff by people I know). If I like it (or if I actually know you), I&#8217;ll add you to the list of links on the sidebar. Instant Google (and Technorati, etc) karma for you (yea I know, it&#8217;s not much but every little bit helps).

Of course if your link is already over there, I know you, love you, and read you already.

In return, if you like reading about our adventures, consider a lil&#8217; link love (wink wink). The internet gods will love you and I will too.

&#8216;Preciate it!

Now of course if no one replies I&#8217;ll feel real special. You know, like the kids on the short bus.
