This year&#8217;s recruitment program was a great success fueled by both the brothers&#8217; enthusiasm and the excellent gentlemen who participated in the recruitment program. As mentioned in a prior article, I am the 2006-2007 recruitment chair for my chapter. I also shared some of [my ideas][1] on building excitement amongst the brothers and the recruits during and prior to the actual recruitment event. In the article I mentioned a few materials that I created for recruitment, which I will be releasing for the first time to the public here. Please note that these are released under a Creative Commons license, meaning that you are free to use them or modify them to suit your own recruitment strategies. This was the sort of resource that I was hunting for when I began preparing my recruitment program, and I hope that these items will help you succeed in your own. (Continue to the next page for previews and downloads!)

Here is a few thumbnails of some of the posters included in the package. SVG (Vector) originals for all the posters are included, so you can print them as big or small as you like, change the text, etc. I have also included some sample brochures that we passed out (both an invitation for the sororities, because we have ladies present during our recruitment, and an informational handout for recruits) for your enlightenment. Hopefully the materials herein will be beneficial for someone, because I know they were for us. Please keep in mind that I am releasing my work under a CC license, but the Alpha Tau Omega Nationals has copyright of ATO, Alpha Tau Omega, and all related images (such as the badge and the interlock). Therefore they may not be reused in any &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; ways. If you find these things useful, please leave a comment or some feedback &#8211; I&#8217;d love to see or hear about what you&#8217;ve done with them! We only ended up producing one poster, the &#8220;Characteristics of an ATO&#8221; poster. It was printed as an 18&#8243;x26&#8243; poster, if my memory serves me correctly. We had the printing done by [LargeFormatPosters.com][2] and it cost around $300 for 20 posters.

Note: All SVG source images were created with [InkScape][3] on a Windows system.
