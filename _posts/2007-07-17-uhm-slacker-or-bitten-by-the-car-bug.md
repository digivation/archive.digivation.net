No new fuzz from me (since I know your just *dying* to hear it). Ever since I installed the sub in my BMW, I&#8217;ve been hounding the BMW forums hunting down other modifications for my car&#8230; and they&#8217;re all outside my budget.

I want some new wheels (somewhere in the neighborhood of 18&#8243;), a sport suspension (that also drops the car about 2&#8243;), tinted windows, clear corners, xenon headlights and projectors, angel eyes, etc etc etc. The window tint I can probably do pretty soon&#8230; the wheels, suspension, and lighting upgrades&#8230; well that&#8217;s another story all together.

Oh and perhaps a supercharger. Maybe I should have looked for an M car instead.

If you were paying close attention, you will notice something rather ironic &#8211; I want to lower this vehicle. That would be the exact opposite of what happened to my last vehicle. Of course you must agree that a BMW with 3.5&#8243; of lift would look a *little* odd.

I&#8217;ve also noticed that the sport of BWM modification is a bit pricier than Jeep modification. Oh well&#8230; stay tuned. I&#8217;ll be doing a writeup on my quick &#8216;n dirty subwoofer installation soon.
