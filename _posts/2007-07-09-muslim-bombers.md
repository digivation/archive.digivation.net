I know, I know, I hear you screaming injustice already. Hush up and read &#8211; I love my diversity just as much as the next guy.

A recent (and hugely non-PC) article in Psychology Today spouts forth this entertaining (and factually supported) list of ten items about human nature that are definitely not &#8220;politically correct.&#8221; Good, cause I&#8217;m no fan of being P-C myself.

> 1.  **Men like blond bombshells (and women want to look like them)** &#8211; apparently this has something to do with the male desire to produce a lot of babies. Oh, and big breasteses and itty bitty waists with those round things in ya face&#8230;
> 2.  **Humans are naturally polygamous** &#8211; really? You should watch [Big Love][1]. It&#8217;s funny.
> 3.  **Most women benefit from polygyny, while most men benefit from monogamy** &#8211; um&#8230; have you ever tried to take care of just *one* woman? Duh.
> 4.  **Most suicide bombers are Muslim** &#8211; something about that polygyny &#8230; all those dudes who don&#8217;t get the ladies have so many sexual repression issues they just have to go blow stuff up! Obvious solution to the war: instead of dropping off soldiers in Iraq, lets ship out some tricks n&#8217; hoes! Come on, ya buncha flippin&#8217; idiots!
> 5.  **Having sons reduces likelihood of divorce** &#8211; Okay, that&#8217;s a new one.
> 6.  **Beautiful people have more daughters** &#8211; sweet! Now find those beautiful old people, cause they&#8217;re gonna have the hott daughters!
> 7.  **Bill Gates and Paul McCartney have something in common with criminals** &#8211; yea, they like money. No seriously, they <strike>get dumber</strike> take fewer risks as they get older.
> 8.  **The mid-life crisis isn&#8217;t what you think it is** &#8211; it&#8217;s actually the *females* who cause the problem.
> 9.  **It&#8217;s natural for male politicians to have affairs** &#8211; money, fame, power = more hoes! Go Bill, it&#8217;s ya birthday, go Bill&#8230;
> 10. **Men sexually harass women because they&#8217;re not sexist** &#8211; yep, we&#8217;re actually equal opportunity when it comes to that. Or something&#8230;

Yea, I&#8217;m sure that got you going&#8230; now go [read all about it][2] ([via][3]). I promise I didn&#8217;t just make all that stuff up!
