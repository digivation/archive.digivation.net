Sorry, no secret connections or anything cool like that (though if I drive to Atlanta I could get to look at one 30 minutes before most folks). In reality, I will not be getting an iPhone next Friday, nor anytime in the near future (though I suppose I could work a few more Saturdays and then get one). However, I think that they are pretty cool, and it seems that Apple has recently opened up the [Guided Tour of the iPhone][1] for your investigation (if you haven&#8217;t already seen it, I&#8217;d recommend checking it out!)

Edit: Here is a direct link to the [downloadable version][2] (175mb). It&#8217;s a ZIP file (compressing a Quicktime movie). Visit the Apple page for the streaming versions, if you prefer.
