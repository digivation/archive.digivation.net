The new season of Heroes started last week and based on the first episode, I&#8217;m really looking forward to this season. I found Heroes one of the most fascinating new shows when it came on last season and it has not disappointed yet. Every episode is well written, uses great special effects, and is very engaging. Heroes definitely still holds a place in my &#8220;must download&#8221; list (seeing as how I never have time to actually watch TV) and it should be on yours too.
