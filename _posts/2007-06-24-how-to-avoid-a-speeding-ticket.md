Obviously, you could just not speed, however, I am placing these tips here mostly for the benefit of my colleague (whose recent acquisitions have granted him some new bad habits), but I imagine there are a few others out there who might find this helpful.

> 1. Drive within 5-10 mph of surrounding traffic
> 
> 2. Try to stay in the middle of the pack
> 
> 3. Find a &#8220;rabbit&#8221;
> 
> 4. Do not change lanes frequently, tailgate or otherwise drive aggressively
> 
> 5. Avoid the fast lane
> 
> 6. Watch for cut-outs and modulate your speed accordingly
> 
> 7. Don&#8217;t speed when you are the only car on the road
> 
> 8. If it&#8217;s ok legally, get a radar detector
> 
> 9. If possible, drive a nondescript vehicle
> 
> 10. Be aware that appearances count
