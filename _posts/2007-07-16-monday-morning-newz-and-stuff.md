After a quick run through the accumulated news of the weekend, I&#8217;ve filtered out some of the more interesting tid-bits for your reading pleasure:

*   [News Grouper][1] has a bunch of parody blogs &#8220;written&#8221; by celebrities from [G.W. Bush][2] to [Britney Spears][3]! Funny stuff.
*   Looks like Georgia is being rather progress! Apparently we&#8217;ve just granted a permit to build the first &#8220;cellulostic ethanol plant,&#8221; which produces ethanol from cellulose instead of sugar. This should result in a much improved energy harvest. Read about it [here][4].
*   Some info on how to [escape from those annoying plastic handcuffs][5]. That should come in handy. ([via][6])
*   Engadget has a [roundup][7] of Guitar Hero III/Rock Band stuff.
*   Looks like the Zune DRM has been [cracked][8] (again). This will free your purchase and wirelessly transferred music. Oh wait &#8230; I use an iPod.

Have fun with those links. I&#8217;ve got to do a little real work now.
