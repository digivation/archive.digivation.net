As I sit here staring at my computer screen, with 5pm looming closer every minute, I find myself at a strange lack of words. At the top of the screen a long list of incomplete ideas, waits patiently for that sudden literary spark. Yes, I know, I should simply sit down and make myself write, yet at the same time I feel lost, my mind full of scattered fragments and lacking coherence. For some reason, the inspiration hasn&#8217;t come to me yet.

Maybe its my writing environment &#8211; a dark office is not the most inspiring place in the world. I think I&#8217;ll try, in the next few days, taking my laptop to a nice open space (far from distraction), putting on some music, and taking a new spin on writing. Maybe that will be the rub. At any rate, stay tuned for new things &#8211; not only do I have a multitude of things to write, I also have a partially complete theme for the site. I&#8217;ve worked on it for a few days, but can&#8217;t quite find that finishing touch. I think I need a weekend &#8211; at least I got paid today.
