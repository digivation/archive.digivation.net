It seems to have been over a month (more like two) since we&#8217;ve really published any amount of new stuff here.

**So I&#8217;m sorry.**

I was jolted back to reality today during a phone conversation with [Dave][1] and he dropped the line &#8220;So you haven&#8217;t updated the site in a while.&#8221; Sheesh&#8230; I deserved that. So I&#8217;m sorry to all the dear readers, whom we love and cherish. Once again, I&#8217;ll try my best to get back to this (and get Chappie back on his game too).

In the mean time, let me catch you up on what&#8217;s been going on for the past two months. First things first, my summer job came to a conclusion and I returned to the wonderful world of academia. This is probably the main reason why updates ceased to a crawl &#8211; instead of spending eight to nine hours per day staring at a computer screen, I now engage in more distracting activities, such as relaxing at the fraternity house. Secondly, we had recruitment. If you think you&#8217;ve ever been busy before, try doing classes and recruitment at the same time. Fun stuff.

On top of being distracted by school, my desktop suffered a slow and painful death and finally &#8220;gave up the ghost,&#8221; so to speak. After working enough to collect the funds to rebuild it, I now am the proud owner of a big blue quad core two-gigs-of-ram and half-a-terabyte-of-storage and a Ge-Force 8600 powered computer. Which means I can catch up on all those games I&#8217;ve been missing out on.

[BioShock][2] is awesome.

And then there&#8217;s the DJ business that Adam and I have been fooling around with. And the five other odd jobs I that compete for my time. And of course women. Ahh the women &#8211; what a wonderful species they are&#8230; but that&#8217;s a story for another time.

So now, with cash in pocket, a shiny [BMW][3] to drive, a big new computer, a new bed (I took some of that money and upgraded my sleeping equipment from twin to queen size), and a bunch of other nice things, I hopefully can get back to my secret love of the Internet and contributing to it.

My next story will be about this bachelor party I went to recently. Or maybe not&#8230; some things are better left unsaid.

So there&#8217;s my excuse. I&#8217;ll let Chappie come up with his now. Chappie? Hello, Chappie&#8230;
