Well dear friends, I am happy to announce the arrival of my brand new Sony Ericsson z520a cellphone. It has all those spiffy features and bling that one would expect of someone such as myself &#8211; Bluetooth, MP3 ringtones, flashy &#8220;bling&#8221; lights, camera, etc, etc. Yea, yea, but it even makes phone calls! Yes, something my old phone stopped doing. So get up off your rumpus and give me a ring!
