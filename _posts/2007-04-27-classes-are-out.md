It&#8217;s almost summer! Today marks the last day of class, Monday the first day of finals.

I&#8217;m excited to see what&#8217;s ahead! I&#8217;ll be in Columbus, LaGrange, Atlanta, Macon, Hilton Head (South Carolina), Lafayette (Louisiana), and other random places this summer, so give me a ring on the cell or drop me a line (matthew at digivation dot net) and maybe some arrangements can be made.
