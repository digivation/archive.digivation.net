I suppose you could now list my car in the garage of the digivation fleet. Now, we are all familiar with my colleague&#8217;s [newly acquired toy][1] as well as the infamous &#8220;[one red jeep][2]&#8220;, but my addition will bring a whole new flavor to the garage. I&#8217;d like to call it &#8220;the Champagne Bullet&#8221;, but I don&#8217;t think anyone would really buy it. I drive a sweet &#8217;98 Toyota Camry. No, it doesn&#8217;t go &#8220;fast&#8221; per say, nor does it handle the off-road conditions very well, but it does <strike>leap tall buildings in single bounds</strike> get good gas mileage, great for [long trips][3], which I find myself taking more often. Suffice it to say that it is a departure from the classic Smithmobiles.[][4]
