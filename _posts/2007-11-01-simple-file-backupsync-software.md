I&#8217;m sure that the software that came with his drive works wonderfully, but I&#8217;m also betting that it&#8217;s proprietary WD software that you can&#8217;t find if you use some other brand of external drive.

There are tons of alternatives available, from full featured (and complicated) backup suites to simple utilities. If you don&#8217;t have significant sync needs, I&#8217;d recommend checking out [ySync][2]. This is a very simple but handy utility that will allow you to synchronize two folders. I use this to copy my music library from my desktop to my external hard drive &#8211; it&#8217;s much faster than doing things by hand. Since I don&#8217;t have any complicated scheme for backing up files (I just need to copy all changes from one folder to another), ySync meets my needs perfectly &#8211; and it&#8217;s free. Grab a copy today!
