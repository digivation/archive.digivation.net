Yes, dear readers, I&#8217;m still desperately busy. I will post eventually&#8230; for now, check out <a href="http://www.davidcomeaux.com" title="David Comeaux" target="_blank">Dave&#8217;s blog</a>, listen to some music, chill, then head over to <a href="http://www.mandolux.com" title="mandolux" target="_blank">mandolux</a> for some nice wallpapers. Afterwards, a nice tall glass of water and a short run should be just the ticket. The only real thing I have to report today is my acceptance to Google Analytics, and my integration of the service into this blog. Looks really cool &#8211; I&#8217;ll let you know how that works out for me. Now, its off to lab &#8211; I get to program a Motorola 68HC12 microcontroller to count the number of times that a certain switch is pressed &#8211; in ASSEMBLER!!
