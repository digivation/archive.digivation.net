<img src="http://archive.digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/chappie.jpg" alt="Chappie" align="right" height="274" width="137" />Ladies and Gentlemen, I&#8217;d like to introduce **Michael &#8220;Chappie&#8221; Chappell**, the newest addition to the writing talent at digivation! I&#8217;ve known Chappie for the duration of my college career &#8211; he is a fellow EE (meaning that we have taken almost the same classes for the past four years) and fraternity brother. Not to be assumed the boring type, Chappie is quite the opposite. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll charm you with his wit, humor, and innovative ideas, and with a face that lovable, who could resist?

Keep a lookout for his first post and I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy his thoughts as much as I do!
