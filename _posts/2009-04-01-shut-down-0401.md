Writing and maintaining this site has brought us immeasurable joy over the past five years and it is with heavy hearts that we must say goodby and close this chapter of web history.

But why, you might ask? The answer is simple&#8230; we&#8217;ve recently developed some exciting new technology and are focusing our time and efforts on bringing it to market. We&#8217;ve been in secret discussions with several venture capitalists and are excited to announce that our efforts will be backed by our new investor, [The Widmore Corporation][1].

Thanks for the memories.

Namasté, and happy April Fools <img src="http://archive.digivation.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
