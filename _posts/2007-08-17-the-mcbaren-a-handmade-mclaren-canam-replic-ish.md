<img src="http://archive.digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/image8.jpg" alt="McBaren" class="right" />Two years ago, Dick Bear decided to fulfill one of his lifelong dreams and build a replica of the [McLaren CanAm racecars][1]. He proceeded to construct a semi-faithful replica (though it&#8217;s only powered by a Honda engine) to work on his metal skills and build something cool.

I really wish I had the time (and money and tools and space) to do something like this. However, [reading about it][2] is a pretty good alternative, I suppose. Of course [the car I want][3] is a little harder to build and ridiculously hard to get a hold of.
