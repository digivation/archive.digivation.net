They are currently trying to get a better understanding of the concepts being taught in their calculus class, and knowing that I have a degree in engineering (automatically making me a math expert), they assumed that I would be able to offer immediate help and provide vast amounts of understanding and insight.

Unfortunately the truth is a little more realistic. It is indeed true that I am an engineer, and also true that I have successfully completed years of advanced math courses. It is also true that I don&#8217;t employ the concepts learned on a daily basis and that &#8220;use it or [it will be relegated to the dark corners of the mind]&#8221; also applies. The fact is as follows:* I haven&#8217;t explicitly used related rates in the past two years *(though I have employed many theorems built upon the foundation of differential calculus). My first thought when asked? &#8220;Related rates&#8230; uh, I don&#8217;t remember those.&#8221; Fortunately Wikipedia came to the rescue with a nice brain-jogging overview.

After sitting down to analyze a few sample problems, I realized that in the brief time since I last did math homework, I had forgotten many important math principles. Fortunately I still remember how to add and subtract, but principles such as the [chain rule][3] (remember our old friends fog and gog?) had slipped my mind. Problems that should be simple ended up requiring a thirty minute review of the basics of differentiation. Thankfully, after about an hour of contemplation, I was able to solve the sample problems and drag some of those math skills (kicking and screaming, of course) from the dusty corners of my mind. Once I was able to do that, I was then able to create a plausible explanation of the concepts for my friend. I have yet to formulate an excuse as to why I did not know all the answers instantaneously.

In case you were wondering, related rates problems are called *related rates* because the rates are, well&#8230; *related*. All problems will center around a known rate (or derivative, dx/dt) and an unknown rate (dy/dt), some sort of equation that *relates *the known rate to the unknown rate for which you must solve (the [Pythagorean theorem][4] seems to be a favorite). Thus, all problems should reduce to something in the form of &#8220;dy/dt = *a** dx/dt&#8221; where *a* is simply a constant multiplier that *relates* the known rate to the unknown rate. The only things that should change is the value of *a*, which could be positive or negative (and actually working through the steps to solve the problem is the simplest way to discover the sign and value of *a*). Of course, your problem could use completely different variables then x, y, and t&#8230; but the premise is the same.

I&#8217;m sure that didn&#8217;t make any sense, and I also do not have any facility on my site for displaying nicely formatted equations, so I apologize but I&#8217;m not going to torture you with a step-by-step walk through with textual representations of the math. The Wikipedia page on [related rates][2] is handy, as is a [quick review][5] of implicit differentiation (also try a [google search][6]). Oh and the image at the top of the post has nothing to do with related rates&#8230; but it does have something to do with differential equations (read about it [here][1]). And as usual, if you have comments or questions, use the comment form and we can start a math discussion!
