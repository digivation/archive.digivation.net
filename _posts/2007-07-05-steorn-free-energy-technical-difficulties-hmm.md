I don&#8217;t know how many of you remember the absurd physics-defying claims of [Steorn][1] from last year, but it seems they&#8217;re out to do &#8230; something. Apparently today is the day when they will actually get their conservation of energy defying machine to work (apparently they had some &#8220;technical difficulties&#8221; yesterday). Steorn claims to have invented a way of generating &#8220;clean, free energy&#8221; from &#8220;magnetic fields&#8221; in a manner which defies conservation of energy. A fabled perpetual motion machine, if you will. As a man of science, I&#8217;m pretty dang skeptical of this baloney.

Steorn has announced a demonstration of its technology (Orbo) in London, but apparently they&#8217;ve been experiencing some &#8220;technical difficulties,&#8221; probably due to something I like to call &#8220;physics.&#8221; But hey, that&#8217;s just me.

To get more on the madness, try [here][2], [here][3], [here][4], and [here][5]. Of course, the following quote is probably a *great* way to start of any non-working demonstration.

> It&#8217;s too good to be true but it is true. It will have such an impact on everything we do. The only analogy I can give is if you had absolute proof that God wasn&#8217;t real.

Hmmm&#8230; riiiight. Well show me the money.

**UPDATE 7/6/07**:  It would appear that Steorn has canceled their demo ([via][6]). Hmm&#8230; doesn&#8217;t that sound about right? I guess the laws of physics decided to come to work today. Darn.

> Further to Steorn’s announcement yesterday (5th July) regarding the technical difficulties experienced during the installation of its “Orbo” technology at the Kinentica Museum in London, Steorn has decided to postpone the demonstration until further notice.
> 
> Sean McCarthy CEO stated that “technical problems arose during the installation of the demonstration unit in the display case on Wednesday evening. These problems were primarily due to excessive heat from the lighting in the main display area. Attempts to replace those parts affected by the heat led to further failures and as a result we have to postpone the public demonstration until a future date.”
> 
> He continued that “we apologise for the inconvenience caused to all the people who had made arrangements to visit the demonstration or were planning on viewing the demonstration online.”
> 
> Over the next few weeks the company will explore alternative dates for the public demonstration.

From [here][7]. Like Engadget said, I suppose it was too much trouble to bring the &#8220;working&#8221; unit in from Dublin&#8230; or turn of the lights. Oh well.
