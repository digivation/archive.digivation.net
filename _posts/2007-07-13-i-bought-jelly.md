I couldn&#8217;t resist &#8211; that was the first thought that popped into my head when I returned to my desk! And it&#8217;s Friday &#8211; you gotta give me a break!

In other news, I&#8217;m headed to the marvelous metropolis otherwise known as Atlanta. I&#8217;m planning on visiting with friends, enjoying life, and maybe eating a little food. There is a possibility that I may attend [99X Unplugged in the Park][1] on Sunday, so perhaps there will be a nice little story and some pictures Monday. But no promises.

Oh, and if you happen to be around the Atlanta area this weekend, and also happen to know my phone number, then give me a call!

And yea, that picture is completely unrelated.
