title: Photo Gallery to Return
author: Matthew Smith
excerpt: Once upon a time, back before the great crash of digivation, there existed a photo gallery of sorts. Well, I am pleased to announce that I am currently working on a new photogallery to bring the gift of occipital candy back to digivation. I am also going to re-enable cross-posting to my (unused) LiveJournal, for all you who want to keep track of me that way. Stay tuned!
