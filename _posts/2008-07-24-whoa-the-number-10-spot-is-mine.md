Some frequent visitors may remember a few articles written last summer involving the ranking of digivation.net against a few search terms. One of specific interest to myself is a google search for my name, Matthew Smith.

It&#8217;s been a long time since I last checked, but on a whim I googled myself and to my astonishment, I&#8217;ve cracked the first page! Digivation.net is now the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">#10 result</span> on Google. It&#8217;s the bottom of the page, but hey &#8211; it&#8217;s still the first page. I&#8217;ve come a long way from the middle of page 5 or 6.

**Edit**: I fell to #12. Oh well <img src="http://digivation.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
