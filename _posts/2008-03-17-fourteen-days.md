Over the past two weeks, I have had spring break, done a lot of maintenance on the BMW, DJ&#8217;d two parties, gone camping, had a job interview, and just plain grown older. Hopefully that&#8217;s a decent excuse for my absence, most of which has been spent covered in grease underneath my car, which now has 100,000 miles on the odometer. Now that some preventative maintenance has been done, and a nice dent made in my wallet, I hope to get another 100,000 miles of of it.

Anyway, this week is just as crazy as the past few weeks. I have a presentation at 9 AM and a research paper due Thursday morning&#8230;

Happy St. Patrick&#8217;s day!
