After reading Mr. Phil Askey&#8217;s [excellent review][1] of the Sony DSLR-A100, I *almost* plunked down $999.99 today. However, I managed to talk myself into waiting a few days; after all, I do have a few bills to pay. I am pretty sure (unless Nikon&#8217;s new DSLR really kicks butt) that I will be buying the A100 within the next few weeks, so be prepared for some of those long-promised media updates to finally land at digivation. Stay tuned for more, and if you&#8217;re bored you can check out my [Flickr][2] or [Zooomr][3] photostreams.
