I&#8217;m currently enrolled in an upper level Christianity class at [Mercer][1] (the great institution of higher learning) and for the mid-term I was required to pen about 2500 words on the topic of &#8220;Sin and Redemption.&#8221; I had no idea where to take this, so not only was I a bit late writing it (last minute, actually), I had trouble deciding how to attack the question. I ended up with something along the lines of &#8220;how should redemption affect the life of the believer.&#8221;

Anywho, if you&#8217;re interested in reading eight double spaced pages on a possibly abstract theological discussion, you can **download the paper [here][2]**. (pdf)
