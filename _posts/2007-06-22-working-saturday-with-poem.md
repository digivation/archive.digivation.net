Tomorrow is Saturday, and Saturday will find me at work. You see, I can clock as much overtime as I wish. And last weekend I got myself a nice shiny speeding ticket in my nice shiny new car, therefore: I&#8217;m working. To commemorate the occasion, I present to you a rarity around these parts: the poem.

> &#8216;Twas a rainy and dull afternoon  
> As I sped through the state.  
> Over the hills and &#8217;round the curves,  
> My shiny bimmer did swoop  
> Till down one hill flew  
> A Georgia State Troop(er)
> 
> Oh what a sinking feeling  
> Did &#8216;er light in my gut  
> For ever I knew  
> I was stuck in a rut!
> 
> No begging nor pleading  
> Would turn his cold heart.  
> He wrote down the offense  
> And left with a nod -
> 
> And One Hundred and Seventy-Five Dollars.  
> Dammit.

And thus, I shall be a-workin&#8217; tomorrow. The eight to five, all by my lonesome.

Update: Ever the helpful one, my cohort Chappie has posted a few [tips for avoiding speeding tickets][1]. I&#8217;m saved!
