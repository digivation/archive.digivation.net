Once I managed to recover most of my contacts through a combination of an old phone and [Facebook][1], I was quite happy with the Razr. Most people immediately laugh when you say &#8220;Oh I have a Razr,&#8221; requiring me to constantly qualify that statement with &#8220;But its the *latest version* &#8211; and much better!&#8221;

The phone was wonderful &#8211; until my roommate splashed some lake water on it by accident (yes, I should probably stop taking my phone to the lake). The phone, once dried out, persisted in rebooting when trying to make calls (or answer calls), loosing signal randomly, and just plain not working right. It got to the point where I was about to throw the phone out the window. Searching the internet didn&#8217;t really give me any insight, so I headed off to the Cingular store for a little help.

The assistant that helped me was most friendly, and informed me that this sort of problem is usually due to a malfunctioning battery and/or a defective SIM card. Being ever so helpful, he created a new SIM card for me and placed an order for a new battery (that guy was really nice &#8211; he didn&#8217;t charge for the new battery). In my case, replacing the SIM card didn&#8217;t solve the problem, but the battery did.

The phone worked fine for several weeks, and then appeared to have started relapsing. However, turns out that I&#8217;m an idiot and didn&#8217;t check the battery &#8211; it had come a little loose and was causing the phone to shut off. Re-seating the battery solved the problem.

So, to **troubleshoot your rebooting Razr**, follow these steps (obviously, if step 1 solves the problem, you don&#8217;t need to do steps 2-5):

1.  Ensure battery is fully seated and secured. Try cleaning the contacts on the battery and phone.
2.  Ensure that the SIM card is properly seated and the contacts are clean
3.  Go to Cingular and get a new SIM card (explain the problem. They are helpful, usually)
4.  Ask for a new battery &#8211; if you&#8217;re lucky you can get a free one.
5.  Time to RMA or replace the phone.

Good luck!
