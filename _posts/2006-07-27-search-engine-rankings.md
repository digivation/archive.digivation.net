Google is a fun toy for bored afternoons. For example, I&#8217;ve been Googling a few key phrases:

*   **[Matthew Smith][1]**: digivation.net is on page 7 &#8211; not bad, considering that there are some 75 million results. Funny thing is, [my Upcoming.org profile][2] (which I rarely use) shows up on the first page!
*   **[Matthew A Smith][3]**: While Google still returns tons of results, many of them aren&#8217;t actually &#8220;Matthew A. Smith&#8221; pages &#8211; a is just too common to use. I didn&#8217;t look far enough to find digivation.net in these results. Moving on&#8230;
*   **[Matthew Aaron Smith][4]**: Same story as above, except it doesn&#8217;t seem that anyone (in the first 12 pages) actually has the name &#8220;Matthew Aaron Smith.&#8221; This is a search string that I could exploit &#8211; to think on that more&#8230; I don&#8217;t rank in this search either, but its obvious why &#8211; I never use my full name on this site. I could possibly come out on top via this search string, however, the only people likely to use such a string are friends and family. Still, it might be worth while, as &#8220;digivation.net&#8221; isn&#8217;t exactly the easiest address to remember.
*   **[digivation][5]**: I hear you now, screaming with indignity; I know, its not fair &#8211; however, there appears to be a company named digivation, particularly [here][6]. However, I rule this search term &#8211; not only does digivation.net land the #1 spot, I also command several other spots on the front page, due to my use of digivation as a username for a multitude of online services.

There are tons of other terms that are fun to search for, but these are the only ones of particular site-wide interest to me. Why? Because the higher I go with these terms, the easier it is for people who know me (one of the main demographics of my site) to find me. And that&#8217;s just cool, right?

I now would like to present to you the &#8220;search for my name awards,&#8221; where I link to the best sites I found by searching for my name.

*   The other Matthew A. Smith award (he&#8217;s even got a PhD) goes to [this guy][7]
*   The Coolest Matthew Smith award goes to [this guy][8] (hey, he was on MTV &#8211; and he may have the best domain name of us all).
*   The Matthew Smith that may have more musical talent (but I didn&#8217;t listen to any of his music) goes to [this guy][9].

Yea, I have way too much time on my hands.
