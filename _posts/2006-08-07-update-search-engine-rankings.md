Since the [initial post][1], I have been keeping an eye the on results of the Google searches and have noticed a few changes. The search of main interest (for the overall site) is for [Matthew Smith][2], as this is the most common way for friends to find the site. After a few re-indexings, digivation.net now ranks as result forty, quite an impressive improvement over the original page seven listing. Now such thoughts as &#8220;Can I become the coveted #1 result&#8221; are being entertained, but at the moment this is only wishful thinking, as I am but one lonely Matthew in a ocean of Smiths.

On another, possibly related note, I have suddenly seen an increase in the amount of attempted comment spam and content scraping. I am not exactly sure what to attribute this to, but it does serve as a sort of &#8220;ego-booster,&#8221; in a twisted way. On the bright side, the scrapes do link back to this site, so I&#8217;m getting a little bit of link love &#8211; maybe this also helps my rankings.

Whatever the reasons and results, the ensuing trends and the never ending quest for a better search ranking is quite an interesting study, and one that I will be following. As I notice other surprising tidbits, I&#8217;ll be sure and post them up.
