That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing. Well, at least let me make a few arguments in my defense. Just a week or so before returning to school I had some crazy stuff going on in my life (if you don&#8217;t immediately know what I am talking about, check out my facebook profile and you should be able to figure it out). Upon returning to school and moving into my new place, I was without internet for&#8230;about a month, which is tragic. So, without immediate or convenient access to the interweb, it was difficult to continue writing, and I gradually lost motivation. Also, I find myself having the majority of my free time consumed with planning&#8230;certain events. Anyway, keeping up the site is not necessarily at the top of my priority list right now.

With all that in mind, those are just excuses, since it really doesn&#8217;t take a whole lot of time to just sit here and hammer out some words. I will try to mak more of an effort to keep giving you something to read&#8230;assuming there are people out there who actually read this (at least Matt will, right?). If you, the reader, have any thoughts on something you&#8217;d like to hear me write about, just let me know. Me and Matt had some big plans on something things to write going into the school year, maybe we can pick some of those back up, who knows? Anyway, don&#8217;t touch that dial&#8230;
