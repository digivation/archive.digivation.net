Just a quick little post to inform you of an essential (in my opinion) patch for Ubuntu 6.06 font rendering system. If you are used to MS ClearType and have switched to Ubuntu only to be disappointed by font rendering, fear not. Using this simple fix, I think that my fonts look better than Windows these days.
