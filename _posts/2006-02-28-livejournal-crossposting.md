title: LiveJournal Crossposting
author: Matthew Smith
excerpt: |
  Dear readers: For your benefit, I have reconfigured WordPress to crosspost to my <a href="http://digivation.livejournal.com" title="Digivation.net on LiveJournal" target="_blank">LiveJournal</a>. I rarely use LJ (what's the point when you have your very OWN blog?), but some of my friends like it as LiveJournal enables them to keep track of others. Therefore, I will let my posts be mirrored on LJ and you can see them there. For those of you wondering, this is accomplished by the <a href="http://ebroder.net/livejournal-crossposter/" target="_blank">livejournal-crossposter</a> plugin for WordPress.
