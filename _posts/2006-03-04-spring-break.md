It&#8217;s more like &#8220;Spring Brake.&#8221; While the majority of my friends and Mercer&#8217;s campus have skipped town in search of more exotic entertainment, I (along with a few others) am remaining in town. I will be focusing on slowing down and relaxing, letting my mind catch up with my body (or body with mind), and just enjoying the mental nothingness of a week without classes. In addition to the aforementioned benefits, the <a href="#" target="_blank" title="15 Day Forecast for Macon, GA - Accuweather">weather looks pretty nice</a>.

Now don&#8217;t just assume that &#8220;slowing down and relaxing&#8221; means I will be sitting around. Quite the contrary &#8211; I am broke. Bankrupt. Nada, nilch, zippo. No cash. Therefore I will be spending the week working the ole&#8217; nine-to-six at Quality Computers. But never fear, the relaxation will still be there &#8211; plus the knowledge that at the end of the week, my wallet will be rejuvenated! There is the faint chance that I may spend the last weekend of spring break at Fernandina Beach, but like I said, the chances are slim.

Stay posted, because I also plan on doing a tad bit of site maintenance. Plus I&#8217;m sure some stories will trickle out over the week.
