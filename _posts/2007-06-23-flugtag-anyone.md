If you are unfamiliar with the concept, teams build unique vehicles which are pushed off the edge of a platform to determine their ability fly. Designs are scored based on distance, creativity, and showmanship. It started in Austria in 1991, is being celebrated today in Nashville, TN (not too far from myself). Sponsored, of course, by Red Bull, it makes for quite an entertaining spectacle. I&#8217;m sure you will be able to find a myriad of videos all of the internet later today, or you could just drop over to the [website][1]. Perhaps one day I will have an entry myself, but for now, I&#8217;ll just show you a couple of my favorite designs. Check out the [design sketches][2], I&#8217;m partial to &#8220;[Eagle One: the Colbert Flyer][3]&#8221; and &#8220;The Pride of the Southland&#8221;. I&#8217;ll update you later on the winner.

Update: Grand Prize &#8211; [Rocky Top Rocket][4]
