<img src="http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/walkencooks.jpg" alt="Christopher Walken! Chicken!" class="right" />I just stumbled across a [site][1] that allows you to share &#8220;cooking videos,&#8221; kind of like YouTube, but for recipes. I find this quite intriguing, as I enjoy dabbling in the culinary arts from time to time, yet I don&#8217;t understand half the directions in some of those fancy recipes.

Imagine my delight when I discovered that Christopher Walken (yes, *the* Christopher Walken) has posted a [video][2] on how to bake chicken!
