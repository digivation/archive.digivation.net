<a rel="lightbox" href="http://archive.digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/800px-lsu_cheerleader.jpg"><img class="right" title="LSU Cheerleader" src="http://archive.digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/800px-lsu_cheerleader-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>This weekend I decided that since [dangerous storms][1] really don&#8217;t scare me, I would travel to Louisiana (yes, that is closer to Hurricane Ike than Georgia) and have a little mid-season football fun and celebration with the LSU crew.

I&#8217;m currently writing from Montgomery, Alabama, where I will be spending the night and morning with my friend Matt before we head on over to Louisiana. So far I&#8217;ve driven through some nasty rain in Georgia and had to replace my aging car battery in Columbus&#8230; hopefully the rest of the trip will run smoothly and without any further car repair purchases.

Tomorrow night should find us at a pub crawl in New Orleans and then Saturday will be filled with tailgating goodness. I plan on returning to Metro Macon sometime Sunday evening, armed with tails of debaucheries and video evidence of our celebrations. Hurray!!

Now to avoid that hurricane&#8230;
