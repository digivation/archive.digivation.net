This new Google maps &#8220;mashup&#8221; lets you locate bars (and clubs and restaurants with bars) near a given location. The site also allows users to add new locations, revise locations, and rate their favorite (or least favorite) bars.

New bars are recommended based a comparison of your ratings to other peoples&#8217;, and you earn points for adding/updating information. Of course no one seems to know what these points do&#8230;

The interface is easy to use, the site is responsive, and they even have a mobile edition so you can relocate when your current bar gets boring. You can create, view, and edit information without signing up, but the site only allows members to rate and earn points. There is also a &#8220;chatting&#8221; feature to assist you in getting your posse together for a little bar hoppin&#8217; action.

Overall, very cool stuff. I think I added about twenty locations to Macon, you know, to help you get your drink on and stuff. Too bad we don&#8217;t rank in the top &#8220;Happy Cities&#8221; list&#8230; Manhattan has 1671 places to get sloshed! Dude, what are you waiting for? Go [check it out][1]!
