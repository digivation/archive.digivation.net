Welcome to the digivation archives! Between 2006 and 2009, digivation.net served as a creative outlet for Matthew Smith and, on occasion, Michael Chappel. Since 2010 or so, both Michael and Matthew have been preoccupied with other persuits and digivation has fallen into disuse. While the digivation.net domain is being repurposed for other things, this archive will serve to keep the content available for posterity.
