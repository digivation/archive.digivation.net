<p>Digivation (a bad combination of “digital” and “innovation”) is first and foremost a soapbox for Matthew Smith and Michael Chappell. We write about topics ranging from technology to fraternities (being fraternal men) in what we hope (aspire, dream, etc) to be a legible banter. Of course we are trained as engineers, so you must forgive our occasional technical babble… just pretend we got excited and started talking some foreign language</p>

<h3 id="history_as_it_is">History (as it is)</h3>

<p>Digivation was born as a spare time project a long time ago (it actually seems like an eternity) by Matthew and this other <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=homeslice" title="n. To be used in same context of of Homeboy.">homeslice</a> by the name of Corey assembled a little “web server” in and hooked it up in Matthew’s closet (way back in 2003) with the intention of creating a website together. The “server” was connected to the ‘net via a nice DSL line (read more about that sort of nonsense <a href="http://www.dslwebserver.com/">here</a>) that worked great for surfing the net (and not so much for hosting a website). The domain “digivation.net” was registered and things got cracking.</p>

<p>Now a period of history exists where Matthew doesn’t recall much about the happenings at young digivation.net until sometime in 2005 when he decided that the do-it-yourself hosting business wasn’t working out too well. The site loaded to slowly to be useful (other than entertaining Matthew’s dreams of grandeur). On the same note, Corey had never been interested in the site much beyond building the little home server, so Matthew bought a real hosting account and installed one of those new-fangled “blogging softwares” and began publishing his thoughts to the world. Times were good.</p>

<p>Then disaster struck. Sometime mid-way through December 2005, some mischievous hackers managed to bring the server hosting Digivation down, deleting all the databases and files associated with the website. Several months of hard work, sweat, blood, and tears (Okay, that’s an exaggeration) – gone. Once the details were sorted out, Matthew decided to try a new blogging platform (the venerable <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>) and <a href="http://digivation.net/2006/01/24/welcome-back/">resumed writing</a> in early 2006. If you’re really interested in things from those days, try a little <a href="http://digivation.net/browse/">browsing</a> in your spare time.</p>

<p>Fast forward more than a year to the next big milestone in the short history of Digivation in June 2007 when <a href="http://digivation.net/2007/06/22/and-now-id-like-to-introduce/">Michael joined Digivation</a> and begin sharing his insights with the world. This development resulted in the <a href="http://digivation.net/2007/06/25/july-goals/">great writing effort</a> of <a href="http://digivation.net/2007/07/">July</a>, netting <a href="http://digivation.net/2007/08/01/july-web-goal-results-are-in/">almost sixty posts and a sharp increase in visitors</a>. It also motivated Matthew to redesign the “look” of Digivation to something that is hopefully a little better.</p>

<p>And that pretty much brings us up to date.</p>

<p>So you want to know what runs Digivation?</p>

<p><strong>Software</strong></p>

<p>The main software is <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> running a custom theme (see below) and paired with <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/">Gallery 2</a> for the photo gallery. These two programs are paired with the <a href="http://wpg2.galleryembedded.com/index.php?title=Main_Page">WPG2</a> plugin, which ties together several key areas (such as the user database). There are various and sundry WordPress plugins performing their special magic everywhere you look. If you really want a list of these, ask us.</p>

<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>

<p>The layout is based on <a href="http://cutline.tubetorial.com/">Cutline</a>, <a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/">Sandbox</a>, <a href="http://getk2.com">K2</a>, and takes a few design cues from <a href="http://warpspire.com/hemingway">Hemingway</a>. Being based on a diverse array of themes, the current layout (which we like to call “Lineway”) has diverged significantly from the original themes. Integrating several of <a href="http://www.pearsonified.com/">Chris Pearsons</a>‘ SEO ideas was one of the first steps (such as employing proper use of H1 and H2 tags). Code tweaking was done all over the place, and the layout was modified quite a bit. Of course you can still see a good bit of the original theme when you look around, but we’ve added several special features to make it better.</p>

<p>At the moment we are not releasing this theme. For other themes by us, visit the <a href="http://digivation.net/wordpress/">WordPress</a> section.</p>

<p><strong>Backend</strong></p>

<p>The backend… well it’s just chock full of all those good things like MySQL, PHP5, Apache, etc etc. We are hosted by <a href="http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/idev/idevaffiliate.php?id=438">WebHostingBuzz</a> (<a href="http://digivation.net/2007/07/03/webhostingbuzz-review/">our review</a>), if you wanted to know.</p>

<p>That’s it for now. Anything else?</p>
