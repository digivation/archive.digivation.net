<p>As for the computing innovation previously alluded too, I am composing this post from an amazing tablet PC by <a href='http://www.motioncomputing%20com/' target='_blank'>Motion Computing</a>. The handwriting recognition is excellent, the screen is astounding, and the tablet is just plain fun to use. I highly recommend checking it out.</p>

<p>In final news, <a href='http://google.com/notebook' target='_blank' title='this link will work soon...'>Google Notebook</a> was <a href='http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/05/yes-we-are-still-all-about-search.html' target='_blank'>recently announced</a>. This handy new online tool will let you store notes, snippets, and other information about a website. You can this share this information with others or choose to keep it private. Who knows what’s next? I’m still waiting for Google’s answer to Yahoo’s purchase of flickr.</p>

<p>Unit next time, hang tight. Matthew, out!</p>
