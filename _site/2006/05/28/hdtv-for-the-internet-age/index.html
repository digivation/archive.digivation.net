<p>While engaging in some light reading Friday afternoon, I ran across a blurb on a new “Internet TV” show, <a href="http://mariposahd.tv">Mariposoa</a>. After a little research, I learned that the entire show is filmed, edited, and produced by four ordinary guys with a little time and some nice (but still consumer level) equipment. The show is “broadcast” (if you can really call this broadcasting) solely online in 720p or 1080i HD formats and makes use of the bittorrent protocol for distribution. I have watched the three available episodes, and I must say that it is quite impressive to see what these guys have accomplished. This certainly does hold potential for a new era of online broadcasting, bringing television and video in the same directions as blogging have brought the web. Check out some of the episodes (or at least the <a href="http://www.mariposahd.tv/mariposagirls">galleries</a>), and let me know what you think. This has definitely started the mind-wheels turning…</p>
