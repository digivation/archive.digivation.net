<p>As some dedicated readers may recall, I work at a local computer store from time to time, usually in a sales/customer service capacity. You may also recall that I live in <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macon%2C_Georgia#Demographics' target='_blank' title='wikipedia on Macon, GA'>Macon with its fabulously ghetto population</a> in eternal tango with the wealthy few that live dispersed around the city.<br />And, as with many other funny stories, the ghetto-ness will occasionally rear its head and vomit up a funny story. Today’s tale actually involves a letter (ahem, <strong>Business</strong>Letter) recently received from what appears to be a local accounting firm. I think the following needs no explanation. Please be aware that this is taken <strong>directly</strong>from the letter. I only wish I could disclose the origins of said letter…</p>

<blockquote>
