<p>To round out my hectic month of weekly trips throughout Georgia, I spent Saturday in Atlanta with Amy. For those of you who don’t know, she is one of my closest lady friends, and seeing her always brightens my day. Unfortunately, my trip to Atlanta was not quite as inspiring – about an hour into my trip, I attempted to avoid an accident on I-285. However, instead of simply bypassing the accident, I ended up meandering about North Atlanta for over an hour. Despite the minor driving setback, Amy and I had a wonderful time discussing any and everything, enjoying a delectable dinner at <a href="http://www.copelandsatlanta.com/version3/index.php">Copelands</a>, and visiting with a few of her Atlanta friends. I miss having Amy around, now that she’s graduated and assumed real responsibilities, but am truly excited for her – she has gotten her first real job as a teacher!</p>

<p>In other (unassociated) news, I am currently formulating preliminary plans to restore a <strike>1980</strike> 1981 Chevrolet Corvette belonging to my uncle. The car has been sitting in a garage for the several years after it was inherited from my grandfather. We will (hopefully and time permitting) perform a body-off restoration of the awesome piece of classic American machinery sometime in the next few months. After completion, I will have the pleasure of occasional trips in a V8 350 Ci sport car… which is quite enough motivation to expend hours toiling in a garage (not to mention I enjoy such things). I’ll keep everyone posted on the evolution of this project, which may well turn into one of the most exciting ones of the year!</p>
