<p>Google is a fun toy for bored afternoons. For example, I’ve been Googling a few key phrases:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=matthew+smith">Matthew Smith</a></strong>: digivation.net is on page 7 – not bad, considering that there are some 75 million results. Funny thing is, <a href="http://upcoming.org/user/45295/">my Upcoming.org profile</a> (which I rarely use) shows up on the first page!</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=matthew+a+smith">Matthew A Smith</a></strong>: While Google still returns tons of results, many of them aren’t actually “Matthew A. Smith” pages – a is just too common to use. I didn’t look far enough to find digivation.net in these results. Moving on…</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=matthew+aaron+smith">Matthew Aaron Smith</a></strong>: Same story as above, except it doesn’t seem that anyone (in the first 12 pages) actually has the name “Matthew Aaron Smith.” This is a search string that I could exploit – to think on that more… I don’t rank in this search either, but its obvious why – I never use my full name on this site. I could possibly come out on top via this search string, however, the only people likely to use such a string are friends and family. Still, it might be worth while, as “digivation.net” isn’t exactly the easiest address to remember.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=digivation">digivation</a></strong>: I hear you now, screaming with indignity; I know, its not fair – however, there appears to be a company named digivation, particularly <a href="http://www.digivation.com.au/">here</a>. However, I rule this search term – not only does digivation.net land the #1 spot, I also command several other spots on the front page, due to my use of digivation as a username for a multitude of online services.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are tons of other terms that are fun to search for, but these are the only ones of particular site-wide interest to me. Why? Because the higher I go with these terms, the easier it is for people who know me (one of the main demographics of my site) to find me. And that’s just cool, right?</p>

<p>I now would like to present to you the “search for my name awards,” where I link to the best sites I found by searching for my name.</p>

<ul>
<li>The other Matthew A. Smith award (he’s even got a PhD) goes to <a href="http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~masmith/mainsite/Welcome.html">this guy</a></li>

<li>The Coolest Matthew Smith award goes to <a href="http://www.supafly.com/">this guy</a> (hey, he was on MTV – and he may have the best domain name of us all).</li>

<li>The Matthew Smith that may have more musical talent (but I didn’t listen to any of his music) goes to <a href="http://matthewsmithmusic.blogspot.com/">this guy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yea, I have way too much time on my hands.</p>
