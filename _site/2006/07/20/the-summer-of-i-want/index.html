Without further ado, I am proud to present my “Summer Toy List.”</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html">iPod Video 60GB</a><br />My old iPod is a 10GB “iPod with Dock Connector” model, and has become a tad dated. While still a fully functional device, it just doesn’t hold a candle to my music collection. However, I’ll probably end up waiting on this one – after all, who knows what the next generation iPod will do?</li>

<li><a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/products/product-detail.php?productid=96&categoryid=18">Buffalo LinkTheater High-Definition Wireless Media Player</a><br />Plays all kinds of media (wirelessly) and costs less than assembling a computer to do the same thing.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.alpine-usa.com/en/products/product.php?model=CDA-9857">Alpine CDA-9857</a><br />I already have a nice headunit in the Jeep, but we all know that the latest and greatest is essential. This headunit plays MP3s, but also connects to an iPod, plays HD radio, and other goodness. Probably won’t actually end up buying this either…</li>

<li>Some sort of D-SLR<br />I don’t know yet, and I’m way confused. There’s the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/images/canon_eos350d.gif">Canon 350D</a> (aka Rebel XT – probably won’t get this one), the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/articles/sonydslra100/">Sony A100</a> (maybe), or the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0607/06072001nikondslrteaser.asp">new, unlabled 10.2 MP Nikon</a>. So many choices… it’s gonna be either the Sony or the Nikon. <strike>And yes, I’m actually gonna buy one of these</strike>.</li>

<li>New Muffler for the Jeep<br />Probably a <a href="http://www.flowmastermufflers.com/40_orig.html">Flowmaster FM40</a>. Big and loud. <strike>This will be also be bought “for sure” this summer</strike>.</li>

<li>Assorted Jeep Toys<br />See <a href="http://www.kevinsoffroad.com/">Kevin’s Offroad</a>. I want almost everything there that I don’t already own.</li>

<li>Other things I havn’t even seen yet<br />There’s always something new out there.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, I’m gonna be spending some cash – unless my more “rational” side (if you can call it that) persuades me to stash most of that spare cash away in Stocks, CDs, and my Savings account. Oh toys, toys, toys…..</p>
