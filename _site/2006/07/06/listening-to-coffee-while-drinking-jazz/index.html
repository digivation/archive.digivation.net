<p>Don’t you love those slips of the tongue? They always seem to strike at an appropriate time and add that extra dose of humor to a situation – take today for example. I was en route to work this morning (my daily 45 minute commute), sipping on a cup of Mocha Nut Coffee and listening to a selection of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelonious_Monk">Thelonious Monk</a> jazz (I bet you didn’t know I was that refined). Suddenly, I thought to myself (yes, I am capable of thought) “strange … I’m listening to coffee and while drinking jazz… this isn’t normal for me.” That little slip put a grin on my face for a good three miles of GA Highway 219. So I challenge you to look out for the little slips in life – the next time you listen to your coffee while drinking your jazz, it might just be a good time to take a break from that solemn stare and crack a smile. After all, laughter <em>is</em> good for the soul.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> On further reflection, the aforementioned slips might not present themselves at <em>socially</em> appropriate times, but still provide great humor (and possible embarrassment). Remember the last time you said “Ruddfuckers” instead of “<a href="http://fuddruckers.com/">Fuddruckers</a>?”</p>
