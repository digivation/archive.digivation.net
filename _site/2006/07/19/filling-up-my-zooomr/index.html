<p>For those of you looking at Zooomr out of the corner of your eye (so to speak), let me invite you to check out <a href="http://zooomr.com/photos/matthewsmith/">my photo stream</a>. I have been spent the evening uploading a few of the pictures on my laptop, but I won’t be able to upload the ones from my desktop, seeing as how it’s back in Macon while I’m here in Columbus. To check out more of my shots, visit <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/matthew_smith/">my Flickr photostream</a> (yes, I’m keeping both). While I’m loading Zooomr, I’m also taking down a brief list of features which I will post later.</p>
