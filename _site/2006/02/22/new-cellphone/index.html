Well dear friends, I am happy to announce the arrival of my brand new Sony Ericsson z520a cellphone. It has all those spiffy features and bling that one would expect of someone such as myself – Bluetooth, MP3 ringtones, flashy “bling” lights, camera, etc, etc. Yea, yea, but it even makes phone calls! Yes, something my old phone stopped doing. So get up off your rumpus and give me a ring!</p>
