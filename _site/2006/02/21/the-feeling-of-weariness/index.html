<p>I have been going, going, going, going. No stopping, just repetitive going. I got to sleep a tad late last night and have been tired all day â€“ after a grueling hour-long leg workout and three mile run, I just never quite bounced back. Therefore, I am going to finish a prelab for tomorrow and hit the hay. Goodnight lovely world.</p>
