<p>Once again it would seem that I have slipped off into digital negligence. Digivation lies slumped in the corner like a Christmas present without the “new.” Why? I really have no idea. It seems that I have been horridly busy over the past few weeks, but when I sit down to reflect, it would then appear that I have been “busy doing nothing.”</p>

<p>In all honesty, the weeks actually have been filled with some amount of productivity. I had a wonderful date a few weekends ago, traveling to Atlanta for dinner and a play (Merchant of Venice at the <a href='http://www.shakespearetavern.com/' target='_blank' title='The New American Spakespeare Tavern'>Shakespeare Tavern</a>) with a lovely young lady. The trip was somewhat entertaining, seeing as how my knowledge of Atlanta driving is rather limited and I really wasn’t sure where I was headed. We originally intentioned to eat at the Cheesecake factory before the play, but unfortunately we arrived too late to wait on a table; instead we dined at <a href='http://www.brioitalian.com/' target='_blank' title='Brio Tuscan Grill'>Brio Tuscan Grill and Bakery</a>, conveniently located next door (and just so happened to have absolutely no wait). In addition to this unforeseen blessing, the wait staff was extremely helpful and the food equally appetizing. After our dinner, we managed to make it back to the theater just in time for our show. Despite being the last couple to arrive in our seating area, we were seated at the left corner of the stage – front row! For the majority of the play, the acting was wonderful and engaging; overall, quite a nice experience, one I hope to repeat soon.</p>

<p>In the arena of college life, Greek life in particular, we just completed Homecoming with Alpha Delta Pi. For the fifth year in a row, ATO has taken home first place – this year by a mere twenty-two points. Our ever so worthy opponents, Chi Omega and Sigma Nu, gave us a run for the money all week long; in fact the competition was so close that we felt positive that Chi Omega had won. We will be doing homecoming with Chi Omega next year, and I’m sure we will be completely unstoppable. I can hardly wait.</p>

<p>Academically, I have been getting along nicely. Today marked the worst day yet, with two back to back exams beginning at 8 AM. Despite circumstances, they went smoothly as can be hoped and at the end of the day I’m still smiling. On the job front, things are still brewing (somewhat akin to a hurricane out at sea) – I’ll keep you posted on that one.</p>

<p>In other news, there is really too much to mention. I’ll try to make it back rather soon and provide further updates and new glimpses into the mind of a young college student.</p>
