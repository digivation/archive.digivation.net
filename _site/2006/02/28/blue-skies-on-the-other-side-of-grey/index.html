<p>Today marks my own personal “hell day.” It seems that everything is due today – test corrections, homework problems, and a nice long feasibility report. To make matters worse, I put everything off until yesterday. I will blame this partially on the fact that I worked all day Saturday and had chapter for nine hours on Sunday. Despite getting only four hours of sleep last night, I am excited – why? Because I’m almost DONE. That’s right, after today its smooth sailing clear to Friday. What is Friday? Well, my friend, the <strong>Friday is the first day of spring break</strong>!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it would appear that at the current moment I will be spending the week in good ole’ Macon, just as I have done every other spring break, working to fund the rest of the semester. Whatever. I work 9am – 6pm so my evenings are free. If you’re around, give me a call and we’ll hang out.</p>
