<p>Dear readers: For your benefit, I have reconfigured WordPress to crosspost to my <a href='http://digivation.livejournal.com' target='_blank' title='Digivation.net on LiveJournal'>LiveJournal</a>. I rarely use LJ (whatâ€™s the point when you have your very OWN blog?), but some of my friends like it as LiveJournal enables them to keep track of others. Therefore, I will let my posts be mirrored on LJ and you can see them there. For those of you wondering, this is accomplished by the <a href='http://ebroder.net/livejournal-crossposter/' target='_blank'>livejournal-crossposter</a> plugin for WordPress.</p>
