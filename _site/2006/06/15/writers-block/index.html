<p>As I sit here staring at my computer screen, with 5pm looming closer every minute, I find myself at a strange lack of words. At the top of the screen a long list of incomplete ideas, waits patiently for that sudden literary spark. Yes, I know, I should simply sit down and make myself write, yet at the same time I feel lost, my mind full of scattered fragments and lacking coherence. For some reason, the inspiration hasn’t come to me yet.</p>

<p>Maybe its my writing environment – a dark office is not the most inspiring place in the world. I think I’ll try, in the next few days, taking my laptop to a nice open space (far from distraction), putting on some music, and taking a new spin on writing. Maybe that will be the rub. At any rate, stay tuned for new things – not only do I have a multitude of things to write, I also have a partially complete theme for the site. I’ve worked on it for a few days, but can’t quite find that finishing touch. I think I need a weekend – at least I got paid today.</p>
