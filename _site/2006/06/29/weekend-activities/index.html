<p>Hopefully everyone has returned safely from his or her respective weekends refreshed and ready for yet another week. Personally, I spent my weekend traveling (or that’s how it seemed). After work Friday afternoon, I took off for Auburn to hang out with an acquaintance and experience a little Auburn nightlife. We all went out for dinner and then spent the evening at <a href="http://www.thehighlandsbar.com/">Highlands</a> listening to <a href="http://www.trotline.net/">Trotline</a> (a country band that is somewhat popular around Auburn) and socializing.</p>

<p>Saturday morning I got up and hit the road again, this time for Columbus. Arriving around lunchtime, I ran by my cousin’s house to grab a change of clothes and shower. I then ate lunch with Ryan and Mark (two of my beloved fraternity brothers) and watched “The Man.” After lunch and a movie, I met up with Justin and crew for an afternoon trip to Atlanta for the <a href="http://www.sisterhazel.com/">Sister Hazel</a> concert, which made for quite an enjoyable evening.</p>

<p>Sunday was spent sleeping, eating, and watching TV, complete with a little wakeboarding action.</p>

<p>I also managed to semi-solidify plans for next weekend (and it’s a long one) – I should stay quite busy (and mobile), with time spent in Macon (Friday night and Saturday morning/afternoon), a possible trip to Atlanta Saturday night, and then heading to the lake Sunday morning. The rest of the weekend is yet to be planned – most likely I will be at Lake Blackshear Sunday, Monday, and part of Tuesday to hang out with Alex and (finally) meet his fiancée.</p>

<p>Sorry it took so long to get another post out – I’ve been getting busier at work, having less time for “other” activities. Till next time, keep it real folks!</p>
