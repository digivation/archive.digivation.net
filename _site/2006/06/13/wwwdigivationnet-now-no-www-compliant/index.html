<p>I am happy to report that digivation.net is now <a href='http://no-www.org/verify.php?u=digivation.net' target='_blank' title='see the compliance page'>no-www compliant</a>, thanks to <a href='http://photomatt.net' target='_blank'>Matt’s</a> handy new <a href='http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/no-www.zip' target='_blank' title='download no-www plugin for WordPress'>WordPress plugin</a> that makes this far too easy (I seriously resent not playing with my .htaccess file). What exactly is “no-www compliance” you ask?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>No-www.org philosophy</strong></p>

<p><a href='http://no-www.org' target='_blank'>No-www.org</a> strives to make the Internet and communications about it as fruitful as possible. To that end, we make the modest proposal that website makers configure their main sites to be accessible by domain.com as well as www.domain.com.</p>
