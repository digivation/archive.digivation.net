<p>Hello everyone, I turn 21 on Sunday. I just thought I’d write that down for everyone’s benefit. What will I be doing on Sunday, you ask (cause, you know, the bars and stuff will be closed)?</p>

<p>On Sunday, my family will be heading to Hilton Head for a week-long vacation – without me. I shall be staying here (I’m not asking for vacation time one week into a new job) entertaining myself in “other” ways. As fate would have it, an Alumnus of my fraternity (ATO, if you missed that) will be in Columbus for the weekend and has invited me over to celebrate. We’re gonna hang out, hit the lake, chill with the ladies, and cause a general ruckus.</p>

<p>So, despite missing out on the family vacation for my birthday, I am content with the following developments (which I will henceforth consider my collective “birthday present”):</p>

<ol>
<li>I have a real engineering job, doing real engineering stuff (and getting paid real engineering money)</li>

<li>I will attend at least three parties to celebrate my birthday</li>

<li>I get to spend my birthday on the lake</li>

<li>See #3, with the addition of beautiful women</li>

<li>See #3 &amp; 4, with the addition of wakeboarding</li>

<li>(undisclosed)</li>
</ol>

<p>Yep, I’m pretty excited about my 21st birthday. Ya’ll be safe now, hear?</p>
