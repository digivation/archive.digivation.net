<p>Since the <a href="http://digivation.net/2006/07/27/search-engine-rankings/">initial post</a>, I have been keeping an eye the on results of the Google searches and have noticed a few changes. The search of main interest (for the overall site) is for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=matthew+smith">Matthew Smith</a>, as this is the most common way for friends to find the site. After a few re-indexings, digivation.net now ranks as result forty, quite an impressive improvement over the original page seven listing. Now such thoughts as “Can I become the coveted #1 result” are being entertained, but at the moment this is only wishful thinking, as I am but one lonely Matthew in a ocean of Smiths.</p>

<p>On another, possibly related note, I have suddenly seen an increase in the amount of attempted comment spam and content scraping. I am not exactly sure what to attribute this to, but it does serve as a sort of “ego-booster,” in a twisted way. On the bright side, the scrapes do link back to this site, so I’m getting a little bit of link love – maybe this also helps my rankings.</p>

<p>Whatever the reasons and results, the ensuing trends and the never ending quest for a better search ranking is quite an interesting study, and one that I will be following. As I notice other surprising tidbits, I’ll be sure and post them up.</p>
