<p>After reading Mr. Phil Askey’s <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sonydslra100/">excellent review</a> of the Sony DSLR-A100, I <em>almost</em> plunked down $999.99 today. However, I managed to talk myself into waiting a few days; after all, I do have a few bills to pay. I am pretty sure (unless Nikon’s new DSLR really kicks butt) that I will be buying the A100 within the next few weeks, so be prepared for some of those long-promised media updates to finally land at digivation. Stay tuned for more, and if you’re bored you can check out my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/matthew_smith/">Flickr</a> or <a href="http://zooomr.com/photos/matthewsmith/">Zooomr</a> photostreams.</p>
