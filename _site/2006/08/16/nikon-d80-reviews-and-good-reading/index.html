<p>Some may remember a <a href="http://digivation.net/2006/08/03/camera-lust/">recent posting</a> about the new Sony DSLR-A100 (aka Minolta) camera that I almost purchased. I managed to wait around and see what Nikon had waiting in the wings (after their <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0607/06072001nikondslrteaser.asp">annoying little teaser</a>) and from the look of things it will be worth the wait. According to various sources, the D80 (while sharing the same/similar 10MP sensor as the Sony) has <a href="http://www.photo-cafe.jp/scoop/archives/2006/08/d80_vs_100.html">much better high-ISO noise response</a>, better features, faster <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/syncspeed.htm">sync speed</a>, and the backlog of nice Nikon lenses. And that little SD card caveat isn’t that big of a deal in light of current prices.</p>

<p>I initially read some material at <a href="http://www.dpreview.com">DPReview</a>, but then strayed over to <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com">Ken Rockwell’s site</a>, where I have become fascinated by his large body of practical advice on camera selection and photography tips. Highly recommended and a great help for putting things into perspective.</p>

<p>Reviews (that I’ve been reading) are at <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/articles/nikond80/">DPReview</a> and <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d80.htm">KenRockwell.com</a> (though Ken’s site is not as flashy, there is a ton of great info there. I have highlighted a few articles below, but I highly recommend sticking around and reading what he has to say.)</p>
