<p>It’s been a few days since my last post. Never fear, I’m still alive and well, although a tad on the stressed out side (which you should find rather odd if you know me) as I am in charge of recruitment. On the bright side, we’re doing quite nicely and I believe I’m still on track for my goal of thirty pledges.</p>

<p>Since I’m so horridly busy, check the archives for interesting stuff and then check back later for new goodies. I’ll be sure to post up more recruitment info after life calms back down a little. Additionally, pictures of “Lake Day” should be coming around soon.</p>
