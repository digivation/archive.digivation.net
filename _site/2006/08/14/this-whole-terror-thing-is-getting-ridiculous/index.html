<p>Ok, so now we call people terrorists and arrest them for <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/13/van_full_of_cellphon.html">buying a bunch of cell phones</a>. Oh, and then talk about becoming <a href="http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/08/13/323226-chertoff-us-should-review-terror-laws">more invasive of personal privacy</a> [[via]<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/13/chertoff_lets_spy_on.html">3</a>].

<p>I would like to know a few things; first, whatever happened to “innocent until proven guilty?” Second, how would the situation have ended if the van was driven by a few nice non-Arab folk?

<p><strong>Update</strong>: As surmised, they have been <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/14/cellphone_terror_det.html">declared innocent</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2 (8.18.06)</strong>: Ok, now its just silly. Check out <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/sanews/index.ssf?/base/news-4/115582084837840.xml&coll=9">this</a>!</p>
