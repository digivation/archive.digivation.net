<p>It’s another wonderful Friday afternoon, and I feel like making a quick “review” post. Ready?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://davidcomeaux.com">Dave</a> and <a href="http://desiree.davidcomeaux.com">Des</a> are <strong>engaged</strong>! Wow – I knew it was in the works but not when (when a guy follows his woman to another school, what do you expect?). Congrats to them!! (<strong>update</strong> – the <a href="http://digivation.net/2007/06/12/cajun-wedding/">wedding</a> has occurred!)</li>

<li>I went wakeboarding this week and <strong>landed a mute grab</strong>. Nothing huge, but hey, its my first grab evar!! Now I just need to get this photographed…</li>

<li>I <strong>almost bought</strong> the new <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sonydslra100/">Sony DSLR-A100</a>, but stopped at the last moment. I then read the preview of the new <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/articles/nikond80/">Nikon D80</a> (released this week). Now I have no idea what I’m gonna get – I have to wait for the production model review to decide – and that’s at least another month of waiting.</li>

<li>Some terrorists almost <strong>blew up some planes</strong>. Now I can’t take liquids or electronic devices on my next flight. Good thing I wasn’t planning on flying anytime soon…</li>

<li>Speaking of the terrorists, a lady had to <a href="http://upgradetravel.blogspot.com/2006/08/food-fight-yes-that-is-banana-in-my.html">peel her banana</a> before flying and this other lady likes to <a href="http://www.animalnewyork.com/2006/08/real_life_web_slinger_entangle_1.php">cover NYC with rubber bands</a> (ok so its <em>technically</em> called <strong>art</strong>)…</li>

<li>Here’s a <a href="http://www.seb4d.com/tutorials/Mattepainting/mattepainting_english.htm">cool tutorial</a> on turning a photo of a house into something more eriee</li>

<li>Here’s a <a href="http://basangpanaginip.blogspot.com/2006/07/worlds-most-photorealistic-vector-art.html">handy guide to fighting back</a> when those jerks at the RIAA decide to call your number</li>

<li>Oh yea, and ’tis high time to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/toilet_paper_caper">start being more careful</a> when TP’ing someone’s house.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, I suppose that covers most of it. I’m spending the weekend in Columbus to attend Ryan and Jenna’s wedding, so I’ll try and take some photos to post up (along with a little narrative, perhaps). With all these weddings and engagements, I’m starting to feel a little “behind the times.” Ho well… ’till next time, “be cool!”</p>
