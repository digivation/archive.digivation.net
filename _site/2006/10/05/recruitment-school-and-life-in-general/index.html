<p>As I sit here writing this post, the mountainous tasks that lie between me and the weekend appear insurmountable. When I actually try and think clearly about things, my mind feels numb and unresponsive – and I’m already halfway done with that mountain of tasks. This week seems to be the culmination of the slowly growing backlog of work that has been assembling since the very first week of school. Senior year – wow; but let us run back to the beginning, seeing as how there have been so few updates since the beginning of fall semester.</p>

<p>The semester opened on a high note. I completed a wonderful summer job at Emerson that paid well and was engaging and served as a great learning experience. Recruitment (I am my fraternity’s recruitment chair this year) was just around the corner and excitement was in the air. I was somewhat prepared for recruitment, though I am notorious for leaving tasks uncompleted until the last minute. However, the first three weeks of school were highly successful (Fraternal recruitment was the third week of the semester, and we were allowed to pre-rush before formal recruitment began), with many well attended recruitment events and a general sense of excitement in the air. And when bid day finally came around, we emerged victorious with the largest pledge class (a total of twenty-one new pledges) on Mercer’s campus. Not only did we get the most, we also got the best. These first three weeks were also when the mountain began to grow.</p>

<p>I was so busy with my recruitment duties that I half-heartedly completed my class work, focusing on other matters. Classes continued, and I have been keeping up with things to some extent, but life just seems so – busy. Senior design, normal classes, study, exercise, work, and social interaction, with not a drop of “me time” left over. Exhaustion has quickly set in, along with a measure of stress. I suppose that’s supposed to be normal for any healthy young college student, but I just don’t do stress. Ask anyone who knows me and you’ll be sure to find that I am an un-stressed and carefree individual. Stress and I do not get along.</p>

<p>Fall break is this coming weekend, and I believe that’s why everything seems to have build up to this point. Projects, presentations, tests, homework, and deadlines all suck, and they’re all hitting me this week. I feel as if it’s time to get on top of the mountain and jump. I just have to make it through tomorrow and everything will be better (at least until the next thing). Which brings us to tonight; I have a communications (electronic, not vocal) test in a few hours which I feel completely unprepared for. I had a test today in another class (which I spent yesterday studying for), a lengthy lab report and pre-lab due this afternoon, and a technical document due yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>Thus, life is stressful and I think I’m going to take a nap, then wake up and study for my test, sleep a little more, and go try my best. That’s all you can do, right? I just want to be able to think again.</p>
