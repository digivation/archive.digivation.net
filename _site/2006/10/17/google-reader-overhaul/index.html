<p>If you havn’t tried <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> yet, I recommend giving it a spin. It’s been my RSS viewer of choice for some time now, due to its simple interface and the fact that I didn’t have to signup for another service (its one of Google’s many web apps). Recently, Google Reader has been updated with many new features that make staying on top of the latest updates a breeze. Recommended!</p>
