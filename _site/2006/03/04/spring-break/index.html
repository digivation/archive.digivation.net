<p>It’s more like “Spring Brake.” While the majority of my friends and Mercer’s campus have skipped town in search of more exotic entertainment, I (along with a few others) am remaining in town. I will be focusing on slowing down and relaxing, letting my mind catch up with my body (or body with mind), and just enjoying the mental nothingness of a week without classes. In addition to the aforementioned benefits, the <a href='#' target='_blank' title='15 Day Forecast for Macon, GA - Accuweather'>weather looks pretty nice</a>.</p>

<p>Now don’t just assume that “slowing down and relaxing” means I will be sitting around. Quite the contrary – I am broke. Bankrupt. Nada, nilch, zippo. No cash. Therefore I will be spending the week working the ole’ nine-to-six at Quality Computers. But never fear, the relaxation will still be there – plus the knowledge that at the end of the week, my wallet will be rejuvenated! There is the faint chance that I may spend the last weekend of spring break at Fernandina Beach, but like I said, the chances are slim.</p>

<p>Stay posted, because I also plan on doing a tad bit of site maintenance. Plus I’m sure some stories will trickle out over the week.</p>
