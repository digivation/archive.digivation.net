<p>So I’ve spent the better part of the afternoon surfing some of the high profile blogs out there, such as <a href='http://photomatt.net' target='_blank' title='Matthew Mullenweg&apos;s blog'>PhotoMatt</a> and <a href='http://warpspire.com' target='_blank' title='Kyle Neath’s blog'>Warpspire</a>, in search of design inspiration. Of course these travels involved many side trips into other cool upcoming services. Some of the more wonderful ones out there include <a href='http://30boxes.com' target='_blank'>30boxes</a> (calandaring) and <a href='http://upcoming.org' target='_blank'>Upcoming.org</a> (event management) – and so many more! The web is finally moving into a huge social network, connecting people and ideas in ways never before dreamed of. Oh, I’m too excited.</p>
