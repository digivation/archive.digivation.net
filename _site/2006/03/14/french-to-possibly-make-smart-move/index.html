<p>As many of you may know, I (among many others) am not a fan of <abbr title="Digital Rights Management">DRM</abbr>, a technology commonly employed to remove users’ fair use rights as related to digital media. In <a href='http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060313/wr_nm/media_france_copyrights_dc' target='_blank'>recent news</a> [], the French (of all people) have proposed a new law that could potentially make it legal for users to circumvent <abbr title="Digital Rights Management">DRM</abbr> – direct opposition to the <abbr title="Digital Millenium Copyright Act">DMCA</abbr> laws in the USA. I must say, I’m impressed.</p>
