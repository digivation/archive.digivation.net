<p>I always hate it when mother is right. “Cursing is something trashy people do,” “You should date around – you’re still in highschool,” “Don’t speed, you’ll get a ticket,” and countless other tid-bits of advice come to mind (all brushed off to be regretted later). It’s painful when I do something, then stop short as the little voice in the back of my head whispers “Mom was right – <em>again</em>.”</p>

<p>Today’s topic is the deadly pitfall known as “fucking around.” I’m sure that you’ve thought about doing it and positive that you’ve seen someone’s life that has wasted away engaging in said activity. You know, when you say “Naa, I don’t really need to go to college and get that degree – I can spend the rest of my life flippin’ burgers!” or “Ahh who cares about (class xyz) I’ll never use that” – only to assume this attitude for all aspects of life, again ending up at the corner fast food restaurant flipping out your meaningless existence for the duration that pitiful thing you call a life. If you’re reading this, it hopefully hasn’t quite come to that – yet. Anyway, Mom was right again…</p>

<p>Today’s story is about a young woman that works at a local restaurant with which I happen to be loosely associated. Once upon a time, in a galaxy far away, there was a young man whom also worked at this restaurant (lets call it S&amp;S) – and he found a certain young woman to be rather attractive, despite being a few years his senior. She was friendly, blond, cute – a young boy’s daydream. Now fast forward a few short years, we find the young woman still working at S&amp;S and the young boy now grown and in college. The young man still visits S&amp;S for the occasional dinner, but has moved on to bigger and better things – and a more fulfilling life. On this one particular occasion, it strikes him as sad, how the young woman is still laboring away doing the same thing she did yesterday, the day before that, the week, month, year … and how tired and worn down she now looks. And then it hits him – mother was right again – it doesn’t pay to fuck around.</p>

<p>So take today’s lesson to heart – don’t fuck around. It leads to burgers, fast food, perpetual fatigue, multiple divorces, six children in a single parent home, and other modern day disasters of Americana.</p>
