<p>Yes, dear readers, I’m still desperately busy. I will post eventually… for now, check out <a href='http://www.davidcomeaux.com' target='_blank' title='David Comeaux'>Dave’s blog</a>, listen to some music, chill, then head over to <a href='http://www.mandolux.com' target='_blank' title='mandolux'>mandolux</a> for some nice wallpapers. Afterwards, a nice tall glass of water and a short run should be just the ticket. The only real thing I have to report today is my acceptance to Google Analytics, and my integration of the service into this blog. Looks really cool – I’ll let you know how that works out for me. Now, its off to lab – I get to program a Motorola 68HC12 microcontroller to count the number of times that a certain switch is pressed – in ASSEMBLER!!</p>
