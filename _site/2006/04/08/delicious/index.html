<p>I know I’m a little behind the times. Maybe I’m a bit hard-headed at times, or a little over “I can do it MY way.” I’ve known about del.icio.us since sometime near its inception but simply refused to use it. Fine fine, take it easy – I’ve finally converted, seeing as how my extensive collection of online bookmarks vanished into cyberspace with the <a href="http://digivation.net/2006/01/24/welcome-back/">rest of my website</a>. I am now in the process of populating my bookmarks page; if you happen to dig things like that, you can <a href='http://del.icio.us/matthew.smith' target='_blank' title='matthew&apos;s del.icio.us'>find me here</a>. I’m sure I’ll run across more nifty uses for del.icios.us soon.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> if anyone reading this uses del.icio.us, I’d love to add your username to my <a href='http://del.icio.us/inbox/matthew.smith' target='_blank' title='del.icio.us inbox'>inbox</a>. Just leave a comment to this post.</p>
