<p>Read <a href="http://royalistparty.org/index.html">this page</a> and you might be a little confused. Apparently the author wishes to bring monarchy to the United States enough to write a web page (in some form of what appears to be Middle English) all about it. Go read and then bring me your thoughts (in the form of comments).</p>

<p>I hope one of their first goals isnâ€™t reverting to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English">Middle English</a>.</p>
