<p><img alt='Wordpress!' class='left' src='http://wordpress.org/about/images/dandy-logo.png' style='float: left;' />I just finished upgrading to the newest version of WordPress. So far, I must say that the administration back-end has received a fantastic overhaul and I’m enjoying the new features so far.</p>

<p>I will soon update the theme to take advantage of the new features, but until then I can’t really comment on the coding aspects (but I know they’re sound). Anyway, I’d highly recommend <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">updating</a> if you use WordPress.</p>
