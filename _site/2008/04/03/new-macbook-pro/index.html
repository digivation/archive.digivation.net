<p>Yea, I know… I’ve converted to the dark side.</p>

<p>If you’d told me two years ago that I’d be owning a Mac sometime in the future, I’d have laughed. However, over the past two years, I’ve used various Apple products at the computer store and helped friends with their Apple computers. I have become quite a fan of the construction and design that goes into these products and I finally decided to add an Apple to my extensive stable of computers.</p>

<p>I purchased the new laptop yesterday afternoon and I’ve been extremely happy with it so far. It’s doing everything I want or need it to do and works flawlessly with my other Windows computers. And of course OSX has plenty of nifty eye candy.</p>

<p>If you’re wondering about the specs, it’s a 15.4″ widescreen with a 2.5GHz Core2Duo processor, 250GB hard drive, 2GB ram (which I’ll probably upgrade to 4GB in the near future), with the nVidia 8600 GT 512MB graphics card and all the other shiny Mac goodness.</p>

<p>By the way, this computer is a graduation present from my grandfather.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks Granddad!!!</strong></p>
