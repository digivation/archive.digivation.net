<p>Over the next few days I’ll be (finally) working on the gallery to get it in shipshape (if you haven’t noticed the complete mess that it has been since summer). You may notice the gallery link is missing. When it reappears, hopefully things will look much nicer!! Stay tuned…</p>

<p>In other news, my brother bought something interesting…</p>
