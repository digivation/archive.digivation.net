<p>It’s late on a Friday afternoon and I’m watching the clock count down the last mintues of the day. Thankfully, I remembered my friends David and Jon keep their musings online (much like Chappie and myself, though Jon posts a lot more than Chappie). You should probably skip on over to <a href="http://www.davidcomeaux.com/2008/09/29/oh-virtuous-schoolwork/">this link</a> and find out why you should eat an ape.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Eating is perpetuating life. In the case of humans eating animals, the eating of animals is therefore perpetuating the capacity for morality, which perpetuates morality itself. <strong><em>Eating animals serves the highest ethical good.</em></strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Also, for those suffering an extra few minutes before the weekend arrives, this <a href="http://www.dooce.com/about">about page</a> is quite entertaining.</p>
