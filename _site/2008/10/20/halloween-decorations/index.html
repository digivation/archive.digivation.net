<p>We’ve decorated headquaters for Halloween. It’s about as ghetto as it gets, but it’s all in good fun.</p>

<p>Apparently we’ve disturbed a few neighbors, some of whom thought that it says “ho” as in “whore.” Not to fear, that’s a Q.</p>

<p>Watch it in HD <a href="http://vimeo.com/2003414">here</a>. This is my first edit with Final Cut Pro (thanks <a href="http://davidcomeaux.com">Dave</a>, it’s cool software), I think it came out ok. Let me know what you think!</p>
