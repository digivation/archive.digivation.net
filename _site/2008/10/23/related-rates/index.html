<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6ssler_attractor"><img alt='' class='right' height='300' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/500px-roessler_attractor1-300x300.png' title='Roessler Attractor' width='300' /></a>A few days ago, a friend asked me a few questions about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Related_rates">related rates</a> problems. They are currently trying to get a better understanding of the concepts being taught in their calculus class, and knowing that I have a degree in engineering (automatically making me a math expert), they assumed that I would be able to offer immediate help and provide vast amounts of understanding and insight.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the truth is a little more realistic. It is indeed true that I am an engineer, and also true that I have successfully completed years of advanced math courses. It is also true that I don’t employ the concepts learned on a daily basis and that “use it or [it will be relegated to the dark corners of the mind]” also applies. The fact is as follows:<em> I haven’t explicitly used related rates in the past two years</em>(though I have employed many theorems built upon the foundation of differential calculus). My first thought when asked? “Related rates… uh, I don’t remember those.” Fortunately Wikipedia came to the rescue with a nice brain-jogging overview.</p>

<p>After sitting down to analyze a few sample problems, I realized that in the brief time since I last did math homework, I had forgotten many important math principles. Fortunately I still remember how to add and subtract, but principles such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule">chain rule</a> (remember our old friends fog and gog?) had slipped my mind. Problems that should be simple ended up requiring a thirty minute review of the basics of differentiation. Thankfully, after about an hour of contemplation, I was able to solve the sample problems and drag some of those math skills (kicking and screaming, of course) from the dusty corners of my mind. Once I was able to do that, I was then able to create a plausible explanation of the concepts for my friend. I have yet to formulate an excuse as to why I did not know all the answers instantaneously.</p>

<p>In case you were wondering, related rates problems are called <em>related rates</em> because the rates are, well… <em>related</em>. All problems will center around a known rate (or derivative, dx/dt) and an unknown rate (dy/dt), some sort of equation that <em>relates</em>the known rate to the unknown rate for which you must solve (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a> seems to be a favorite). Thus, all problems should reduce to something in the form of “dy/dt = <em>a*</em> dx/dt” where <em>a</em> is simply a constant multiplier that <em>relates</em> the known rate to the unknown rate. The only things that should change is the value of <em>a</em>, which could be positive or negative (and actually working through the steps to solve the problem is the simplest way to discover the sign and value of <em>a</em>). Of course, your problem could use completely different variables then x, y, and t… but the premise is the same.</p>

<p>I’m sure that didn’t make any sense, and I also do not have any facility on my site for displaying nicely formatted equations, so I apologize but I’m not going to torture you with a step-by-step walk through with textual representations of the math. The Wikipedia page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Related_rates">related rates</a> is handy, as is a <a href="http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~kouba/CalcOneDIRECTORY/implicitdiffdirectory/ImplicitDiff.html">quick review</a> of implicit differentiation (also try a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=implicit+differentiation">google search</a>). Oh and the image at the top of the post has nothing to do with related rates… but it does have something to do with differential equations (read about it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6ssler_attractor">here</a>).
