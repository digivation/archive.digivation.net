<p>The weekend is two dreadful hours away. I can almost taste it (or maybe that’s the taste of the coffee I drank earlier). At any rate, it’s a three day weekend with a nice weather outlook (unlike the forecast for last night’s trip to the fair, I think this one might just stick). I’m attending a five-year highschool reunion tonight, after which I will get to hang out with Matt for a little while. Tomorrow, I’m not exactly sure what’s going on, but I think a few friends and I are headed to Milledgeville to investigate the festivities. Sunday holds a trip to Six Flags for some classic adrenaline-junkie fun. Monday is still open.</p>

<p>Maybe on Monday I’ll have a few minutes to sit down and finish some other articles I’m working on.</p>

<p>Anyway, have a good weekend and enjoy your Columbus day (even if you have to work)!</p>
