<p>Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock for the past few months, you should be quite aware of the current <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/97915-the-credit-hostage-crisis">financial</a> <a href="http://mises.org/story/3128">situation</a> creeping across the globe like a cancer. While many people are full of gloom and doom, and the talking heads on your TV keep telling you that the end of the world is near, I personally see this as a time of great opportunity. I am excited about a market crash and the subsequent emergence of winners (chosen by free market rules, not <a href="http://mises.org/story/3132">stupid legislations</a>).</p>

<p>Why? Because I have the great opportunity of entering the market just as a new cycle begins. Everyone is selling out, putting their money into less volitile commodities (gold, oil, etc), and driving the stock prices of great companies into the ground. By picking the strong companies with solid foundations and business practices that will weather the storm, one can by greatly devalued stock and when the market recovers, make a small fortune.</p>

<p>That’s my plan. What’s yours?</p>
