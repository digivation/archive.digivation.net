<h3 id="the_making_of">The Making Of</h3>

<p>When my roommates and I originally decided to do a Christmas card, we were planning on sending out a normal paper card, adorned with a picture of the three of us in a rather cheesy typical Christmas pose. We hauled out the camera and tripod and proceded to configure and light our scene. During this process, I happened to take a number of test shots to get the lighting right. When we sat down to review the pictures, my infamous “iTunes library on shuffle” just so happened to play “Kiss” by Prince … and the rest is history.</p>

<p>All the shots were arranged in Premiere and the titles were created in After Effects. My video skillz are improving, though I’m not sure how we’re gonna top this next year…</p>

<p>I’ll add details if anyone is interested, but for now I just wanna get this out there! Enjoy!</p>
