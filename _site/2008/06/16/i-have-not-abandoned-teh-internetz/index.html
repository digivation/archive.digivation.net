<p>Never fear, I’m still here. I’m just busy trying to get moved into my new place and adjust to life after college. I start my new job at Robins AFB on Monday, June 23rd. Sometime after I get situated in that, I’ll be back with fresh new words for the site, so stay tuned.<br />Ps, you should come by the new house if you haven’t been yet. It’s pretty awesome.</p>
