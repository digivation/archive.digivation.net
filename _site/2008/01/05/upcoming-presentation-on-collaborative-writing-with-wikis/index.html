<p>On <strong>January 16, 2008</strong>, I, Matthew Smith, will be delivering a presentation for STC on the use of wikis in collaborative writing projects. This presentation will be based on a shorter presentation I gave for one of my technical communications classes last year. I don’t have the final details on the presentation yet (aside from the date), but I’m assuming it will be in <strike>the auditorium</strike> <strong>room 201</strong> of the new <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&t=h&msa=0&msid=113001744340219610496.00044302be17004b7a528&ll=32.827421,-83.649918&spn=0.003678,0.004565&z=18&om=1&iwloc=00044302c1d4b6203a464">Science and Engineering Building</a> <strike>around 7pm</strike> <strong>at 6pm</strong>(that’s on Mercer’s Macon campus if you didn’t know). I hope that the presentation will be informative and inspire people to find new ways to employ the versatile wiki. If you’re not busy, I’d love it if you dropped by!</p>
