<p><a href='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/matthew.jpg' rel='lightbox' title='Matthew Smith'><img alt='Matthew Smith' class='left' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/matthew.thumbnail.jpg' /></a>This has been a busy but great week. I’ll be back with more detail on some of these events, but I gave a presentation last night (which went really well, and the video and other information will be online soon), helped a friend assemble a new computer today, I’ve been in the gym three days this week (and tomorrow will be the fourth – getting back into shape), I’ve done a little homework (love only taking 12 hours of class), and I’ve been working a few hours a day to boot!</p>

<p>Speaking of work, I’ve been developing some Windows scripts to help with system administration. They may be simple but I think that they are <strong>super-cool</strong>! I’ve been learning to work with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation">WMI</a> through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript">JScript</a> (not because I love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Script_Host">WSH</a> or JScript or anything, but it’s built into all the machines I manage and JScript looks more like the languages I’m familiar with than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript">VBScript</a>… read <a href="http://www.windowsdevcenter.com/pub/a/windows/2007/06/19/eight-reasons-windows-administrators-should-learn-jscript-instead-of-vbscript.ht">this</a> for some other reasons) and it allows me to do some really cool things. The coolest part is that these functions <strong>can be executed against either a local machine or a <em>remote machine</em></strong>… which means I could write some scripts that scan the network and create reports of certain configuration settings on all the machines that are found. I’ll be writing more on this later, and probably create a site section dedicated to these code snippets I’ve been creating (they are reusable and can be inserted into many scripts).</p>
