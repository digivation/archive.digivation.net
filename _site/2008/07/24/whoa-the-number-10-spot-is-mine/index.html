<p>Some frequent visitors may remember a few articles written last summer involving the ranking of digivation.net against a few search terms. One of specific interest to myself is a google search for my name, Matthew Smith.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time since I last checked, but on a whim I googled myself and to my astonishment, I’ve cracked the first page! Digivation.net is now the <span style='text-decoration: line-through;'>#10 result</span> on Google. It’s the bottom of the page, but hey – it’s still the first page. I’ve come a long way from the middle of page 5 or 6.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I fell to #12. Oh well <img alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' src='http://digivation.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' /></p>
