No, I’m not “slow” or “behind the times.” My phone was, until recently, attached to my parents’ family plan – and they blocked all messages instead of paying the extra $30/month. Since I now have my own steady income, I have spun my number off to my own plan and enabled text messages in the process. Hurray for independence (and the costs of such freedom).</p>

<p>Shortly after beginning my own “sms revolution,” a few people began complaining that messages they received contained an “@” between each word of the message. Of course I immediately think “well obviously that’s an encoding problem.” And sure enough… here’s how you solve it:</p>

<p>Navigate to <em>Options -&gt; SMS Text</em> and change <em>Data Coding</em> to <em>7 bit</em>. I’m assuming it was previously set to <em>UCS2</em>. A quick word of warning: if you need to send messages containing some foreign characters, you must leave your encoding set to UCS2 and tell your friends to get a better phone. Another bonus is that now your messages can actually contain 160 characters instead of the 62 character limit of the extended letter set.</p>
