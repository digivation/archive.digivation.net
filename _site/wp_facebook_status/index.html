<p><strong>Facebook Status for WordPress</strong></p>

<p>Ok here’s the idea: For those of you who don’t know, <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> is a social platform with a huge number of users. In fact, many of the people I know have Facebook accounts… so clearly, tying the social network of Facebook into the blogs of the users would be kind of cool. Facebook provides an <a href="http://developers.facebook.com">API</a> that allows for access to a good bit of data in their network, so all one needs to do is tie this into a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">WordPress plugin</a> so that we can then call forth data using nice easy template tags (or something of the sort).</p>

<p>Since we must crawl before we can walk, I think it should be simple enough to pull out your Facebook status and display it in your WordPress blog.</p>

<p>Now I just need to sit down and do this.</p>
