<p><img alt='Falling Balls' class='right' height='246' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/balls.jpg' title='Falling Balls' width='262' />I’ve really been enjoying <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>, the web browser created by Google which features the “blazingly fast” V8 JavaScript engine. To show off the features of the JS engine, they’ve created a site called <a href="http://www.chromeexperiments.com/">Chrome Experiments</a> (via <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/chrome-experiments-are-here.html">Google Blog</a>). There’s some really cool stuff there (check out the <a href="http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/browser-ball/">Browser Ball</a> demo), but I think my favorite is <a href="http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/ball-pool/">Ball Pool</a>… it’s fun <em>and</em> it makes cool looking paterns! There’s also a few neat 3D demos.</p>

<p>I’d recommend checking them out, though you may need Google Chrome or a late version of Firefox or Safari to view them.</p>
