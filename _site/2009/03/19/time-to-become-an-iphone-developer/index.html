<p><img alt='Apple Developer Program' class='right' height='151' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/apple_dev.jpg' title='Apple Developer Program' width='224' />Just in case you missed it, Apple <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/17/live-from-apples-iphone-os-3-0-preview-event/">announced</a> the latest OS for the iPhone (and iTouch), <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/preview-iphone-os/">version 3.0</a>, on Tuesday. It includes a ton of new features, mostly in the programming department (though copy and paste will be a welcome addition, as will the new MMS feature … no more viewmymessage.com texts!). The OS will be open to consumers in June, but is currently avaliable for registered developers (must be a paid developer, not a free one). Me, being totally impatient about this, was twittering about the OS upgrade and recieved an offer to go in on a dev team and split the cost of membership. This will give me (legal) access to the 3.0 beta OS, the 3.0 SDK, and the ability to test any software I write on the phone itself.</p>

<p>I’m doing it. I’ll post my thoughts when I get signed up. And who knows, maybe this will even result in some software for your iPhone!</p>
