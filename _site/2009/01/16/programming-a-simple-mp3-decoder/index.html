<p>This morning’s purusal of the interwebs presented me with a particularly interesting gem: a good <a href="http://blog.bjrn.se/2008/10/lets-build-mp3-decoder.html" title="Let's build an MP3 decoder">article about MP3 decoding</a>. It’s written with a nice overview of the format and builds up to a limited but functional bit of code that can actually decode an MP3. Even if you aren’t into programming, I’d recommend skimming it, as it’s nice to know more about something so commonplace but usually never given a second thought.</p>
