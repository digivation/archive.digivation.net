<p>Normal People do their resolutions before the beginning of the new year. I do mine much later. Without further ado:</p>

<p>I, Matthew A. Smith, in the <span style='text-decoration: line-through;'>nineth</span> tenth year of the <span style='text-decoration: line-through;'>second</span> third millenium, hereby resolve to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Travel to at least 50 places I’ve never been before</li>

<li>Get in the best shape of my life</li>

<li>Look for adventure in the mundane</li>

<li>Drink less alcohol</li>

<li>Eat better</li>

<li>Save $15,000</li>

<li>Redesign my website, and actually roll out a complete site on time</li>

<li>Create more videos</li>

<li>Take more pictures</li>

<li>Post content regularly, and of greater variety (see also, number 7)</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, let’s see if I can pull this off… What about you?</p>

<p><small>2000 would be the first year of the third millenium, correct… I originally had 1008?</small></p>
