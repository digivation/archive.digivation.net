Always the optimist, I feel that changes are quite needed and I’m always seeing the best in the opportunity.</p>

<p>To reflect the change in regime, President Obama’s crack web team has put up a brand new site at <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">Whitehouse.gov</a>, and I must say, I like it quite a lot! It has a very modern, up to date feel and seems easy to navigate. I wish I knew more about the backend, but a (very) cursory glance at the source didn’t shed any light (I’m assuming it is a custom coded backend).</p>

<p>Kottke has a most revealing glance at the <a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/01/the-countrys-new-robotstxt-file">change in Whitehouse.gov/robots.txt</a>, which is what prompted my first glance at the site.</p>

<p>Hurray for change… here’s to the future!</p>
