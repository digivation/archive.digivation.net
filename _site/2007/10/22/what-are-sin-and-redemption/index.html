<p>I’m currently enrolled in an upper level Christianity class at <a href="http://mercer.edu/">Mercer</a> (the great institution of higher learning) and for the mid-term I was required to pen about 2500 words on the topic of “Sin and Redemption.” I had no idea where to take this, so not only was I a bit late writing it (last minute, actually), I had trouble deciding how to attack the question. I ended up with something along the lines of “how should redemption affect the life of the believer.”</p>

<p>Anywho, if you’re interested in reading eight double spaced pages on a possibly abstract theological discussion, you can <strong>download the paper <a href="http://digivation.net/downloads/documents/sin-and-redemption.pdf">here</a></strong>. (pdf)</p>
