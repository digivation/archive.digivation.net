<p>I’ve returned from Louisiana (which was amazing and will be getting a post shortly) and I’m swamped with work. When I get a break from my class work, I’ll mention get on it, so to speak.</p>

<p>At any rate, I have indeed returned from my 1,100 mile trek across the southern states in one piece.</p>
