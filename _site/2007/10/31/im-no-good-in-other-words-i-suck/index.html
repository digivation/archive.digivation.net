<p><img alt='this has nothing to do with the topic' class='right' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/470_shanewarnhead20.thumbnail.jpg' />And time lapses yet again. Same story, busy busy, etc etc. I’m sorry.</p>

<p>I must also apologize to Chappie, because the editor has been “broken” since I upgraded <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> to version 2.3. However, it’s fixed now and everything has been upgraded to the latest versions.</p>

<p>Chappie, if you have any problems let me know.</p>

<p>Now I’m off to write some real content.</p>
