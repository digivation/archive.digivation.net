<p>In the past I’ve written about David’s music (both his personal stuff and <a href="http://digivation.net/2007/06/29/dave-does-la-bamba">things</a> he’s done with the Newtons). David, a true connoisseur of music, is both an artist and a producer, and as both, his music represents a continual evolution of sound. Dave’s first efforts at recording and producing a sound can be heard on the Newton’s album.</p>

<p>Compared to David’s most recent works, the music production on the Newtons album sounds feeble and undeveloped. However, the Newtons represented an important first step and a significant experimental milestone. I believe that if Dave had his current knowledge and skill when he recorded the Newtons album, the CD would have be absolutely amazing.</p>

<p>Enough about the Newtons – David’s most recent work, Good Morning Coffee (a song written around the lyrics of the great <a href="http://johncomeaux.com/">John Comeaux</a>) represents a new pinnacle in the evolution of David the producer. Better yet, the same song was recorded in two radically different styles, giving David even more room to flex his developing acoustic muscles.</p>

<p>The sound quality on these two pieces is amazing (especially when you consider that David does all his work with an iMac, a little cool hardware, and no real studio). I believe that the sound on these two recordings rivals that of many “professionally mastered” recordings. I was even more astounded when David showed me some new little tricks that he has learned and the subtle but profound effect they have on the recordings.</p>

<p>Anyway, without further ado, here is Good Morning Coffee – the country and the blues version! (read Dave’s comments on the <a href="http://www.davidcomeaux.com/2007/08/15/good-morning-coffee-country/">country</a> and <a href="http://www.davidcomeaux.com/2007/08/31/good-morning-coffee-blues-version/">blues</a> versions)</p>
