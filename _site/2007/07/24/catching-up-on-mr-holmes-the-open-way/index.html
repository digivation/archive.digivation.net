And what better way to do this than with the wonderful free resource known as <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">Project Gutenberg</a>? If you’ve not yet heard of Gutenberg (or the new <a href="http://demo.openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a>), you really need to stop by and check them out. Project Gutenberg is a much older project with many full-text copies of public domain works (you can read the complete text of great books) while the Open Library is a much newer project with less content and a broader aim – they wish to create a catalog of every book on the planet (with full text for public domain works).</p>

<p>For now, Gutenberg is the place to go if you want to read such great classics as “<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/74">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</a>” or “<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1342">Pride and Prejudice</a>,” while the Open Library has a ways to go (but they do have a cool online book reader). I’m working my way through these great books by <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/d#a69">Sir Author Conan Doyle</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/244">A Study in Scarlet</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2097">The Sign of the Four</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2852">The Hound of the Baskervilles</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3289">The Valley of Fear</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Along with a ton of other short stories and collections you’ll find <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/d#a69">here</a>, along with a good list of some of Conan’s favorites <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes#Bibliography">here</a>.</p>
