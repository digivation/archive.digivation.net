I attended my first <a href="http://www.maconbaseball.com">Macon Music</a> game, highlighted by a rousing performance of the National Anthem by my friend Sam. Other than that, the game was uneventful and the weather was oppressive. I’m not even sure who won since we left halfway through the seventh inning.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoon I went to watch <a href="http://www.disney.go.com/disneypictures/ratatouille/">Ratatouille</a> with some friends, which turned out to be a very “cute and entertaining” movie. I’m almost certain that’s the first G-rated movie I’ve seen in a looong time, but I enjoyed it anyway. The characters were quite likable (despite a certain rat-like appearance) and the storyline was engaging and playful. If you’re unsure about it, just go to a matinée showing.</p>

It is certainly one of the coolest phones I’ve ever seen, with a beautiful display and intuitive user interface. Navigating around did not take long to figure out, though there were a few instances when I would have to hunt to figure something out, but you could easily get accustomed to using it in a day or two.</p>

<p>For Independence Day, I’m planning on heading back to Macon (despite the additional driving, it will be more fun than staying in LaGrange or Columbus). I believe we’re grilling out for dinner and then heading to the country club to watch the firework show. If you’re interested in joining our holiday celebrations, call me.</p>
