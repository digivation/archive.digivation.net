<p>Last night as I was showering, a brilliant idea dawned on me: What if I could combine Facebook’s social graph with my WordPress blog? Integrated commenting, latests posts showing up on my feed, etc etc etc. I was all set to write this spiffy post outlining some new ideas and proposing a new plugin when I ran across <a href="http://photomatt.net/2007/07/19/wordpresscom-facebook-app/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Seems they <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/wordpress-com/">beat me to it</a>. Oh well … Unfortunately it only works with <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> blogs for now, but the possibility of opening the functionality to hosted blogs (such as this one) will come if we ask for it (or write it ourselves). I am not using a WordPress.com blog, so I can’t tell you if it works well or not, but you can read more about it <a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2007/07/18/facebook/">here</a> if you’re interested.</p>

<p>The best part? The story excerpts in your feed link straight to the blog post!  I currently use the Facebook Notes RSS import feature, which requires several clicks to arrive at the actual post… rather annoying.</p>
