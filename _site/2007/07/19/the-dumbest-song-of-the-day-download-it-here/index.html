<p>I was browsing through a certain collection of songs that I recently “received” and after listening to all of them, I must say: the most retarded song of the day is <strong>A Bay Bay</strong> by Hurricane Chris.</p>

<p>Yes, you read that right. Not a misspelling. Despite the rather retarded name, it just so happens to be catchy. I can envision dancin’ to this one up in da’ club pretty soon.</p>

<p>Listen to it here or <a href="http://www.digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/hurricane_chris-a_bay_bay.mp3">download</a> it.</p>
