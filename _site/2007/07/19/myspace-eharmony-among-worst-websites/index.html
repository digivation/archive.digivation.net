<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/">Time online</a> has generated a short list (very short) of the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1638344_1638341,00.html">worst sites</a> infiltrating our beloved Interweb. I would have to greatly agree with the evaluation of these journalists as most of these sites just plain annoy me. The list is as follows:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eharmony.com">eHarmony.com</a> – After completing your 426 question survey and paying your monthly premium, you can still possibly be rejected as “unmatchable”.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.evite.com">Evite.com</a> – Have you ever gotten one of these? Not worth the time/effort. Good idea gone terribly wrong, use facebook.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meez.com">Meez.com</a> – Never heard of it. Apparently a service to trash up your e-mail (and take up too much space in inboxes) .</p>

<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace.com</a> – Agreed. Justice.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.secondlife.com">SecondLife.com</a> – Live a second life online, if you can spend a few hours figuring it out, and then enough time to lead another life (slow loading times included).</p>

<p>Now, they have also composed another list of “<a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1638266_1638253,00.html">25 Sites We Can’t Live Without</a>” which contains several of my regular visits including <a href="http://www.espn.com">ESPN.com</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://www.ebay.com">Ebay.com</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com">Google.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com">HowStuffWorks.com</a>, among others. Check out the lists, which sites do you think are the worst? Which can’t you live without?</p>
