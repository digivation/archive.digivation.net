<p>I know, I know, I hear you screaming injustice already. Hush up and read – I love my diversity just as much as the next guy.</p>

<p>A recent (and hugely non-PC) article in Psychology Today spouts forth this entertaining (and factually supported) list of ten items about human nature that are definitely not “politically correct.” Good, cause I’m no fan of being P-C myself.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Men like blond bombshells (and women want to look like them)</strong> – apparently this has something to do with the male desire to produce a lot of babies. Oh, and big breasteses and itty bitty waists with those round things in ya face…</li>

<li><strong>Humans are naturally polygamous</strong> – really? You should watch <a href="http://hbo.com/biglove/">Big Love</a>. It’s funny.</li>

<li><strong>Most women benefit from polygyny, while most men benefit from monogamy</strong> – um… have you ever tried to take care of just <em>one</em> woman? Duh.</li>

<li><strong>Most suicide bombers are Muslim</strong> – something about that polygyny … all those dudes who don’t get the ladies have so many sexual repression issues they just have to go blow stuff up! Obvious solution to the war: instead of dropping off soldiers in Iraq, lets ship out some tricks n’ hoes! Come on, ya buncha flippin’ idiots!</li>

<li><strong>Having sons reduces likelihood of divorce</strong> – Okay, that’s a new one.</li>

<li><strong>Beautiful people have more daughters</strong> – sweet! Now find those beautiful old people, cause they’re gonna have the hott daughters!</li>

<li><strong>Bill Gates and Paul McCartney have something in common with criminals</strong> – yea, they like money. No seriously, they <strike>get dumber</strike> take fewer risks as they get older.</li>

<li><strong>The mid-life crisis isn’t what you think it is</strong> – it’s actually the <em>females</em> who cause the problem.</li>

<li><strong>It’s natural for male politicians to have affairs</strong> – money, fame, power = more hoes! Go Bill, it’s ya birthday, go Bill…</li>

<li><strong>Men sexually harass women because they’re not sexist</strong> – yep, we’re actually equal opportunity when it comes to that. Or something…</li>
</ol>

<p>Yea, I’m sure that got you going… now go <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20070622-000002.xml">read all about it</a> (<a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/07/2015224&from=rss">via</a>). I promise I didn’t just make all that stuff up!</p>
