<p><img align='right' alt='harry potter and the deathly hallows' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/hpdhcover.thumbnail.jpg' />It seems the great “internets” have brought us a pre-release copy of the latest Harry Potter book , snagged with a digital camera. I won’t be reading it because I haven’t read any of the other books and I really don’t care all that much – no offense. Apparently the quality is kinda low in some places (after all, its a bunch of pictures of the pages), but from my understanding, it’s readable.</p>

<p>But if you just can’t wait (perhaps your interest was piqued by my <a href="http://digivation.net/2007/07/16/the-great-debate/">college’s post</a>), I suppose a search for “Harry Potter” at some site like <a href="http://thepiratebay.org">this</a> might just sedate you for a few days. I’ll have you know that I haven’t downloaded or searched for this book, I’m just repeating <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/07/17/last_harry_potter_le.html">something</a> I <a href="http://machinist.salon.com/blog/2007/07/17/potter_leaked/index.html">read</a> because it makes me smile. More power to the all knowing “internets!”</p>
