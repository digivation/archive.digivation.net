<p>Not only did I snag these from <a href="http://www.scaryideas.com">Scaryideas</a>, but this is a little trial of the <a href="http://digivation.net/wp-gallery2.php">photo gallery</a> (currently unfinished). Click the pictures to view the full size image and find a few more on the <a href="http://digivation.net/v/soccerchicks/">same topic</a>.</p>
