<p>I was visiting some friends in Columbus last night when this little tidbit crossed within earsight (not an exact quote):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I heard that they just passed this new law that gives you a like $200 ticket for talking on your cellphone without a hands free device and that they will pull you over if you are more than 3 MPH over the speed limit, instead of 9 MPH.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounded a little fishy to me, but what do I know; I don’t watch the news or read the papers (they’re usually full of the same old BS day after day, it tires me). However, I do believe in perusing the “internets” for my information.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/traffic/california.asp">Snopes</a> and the <a href="http://www.gahighwaysafety.org/whatsnewatgohs/viewnews.asp?newsID=332">Georgia DMV</a>, this (circulating email rumor) is FALSE. The fines have not been increased, etc etc. Oh, and you can be pulled over for 1 MPH over the speed limit, but it has always been like that – it’s up to the officer.</p>

<p>Now get in your car and go do a little speeding – please talk on your celly while doing it, okay?</p>
