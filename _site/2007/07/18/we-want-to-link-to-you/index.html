<p><img align='right' alt='Link Love!' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/link-love.jpg' />I love “networking” with my friends and I love reading their thoughts, ideas, and adventures. Therefore, in the spirit of networking and the internet, I want to read more of your blogs – my reading list is full of tech news and other interesting things but seriously lacking in the “people I know” department. Thus, I propose this:</p>

<p><strong>Send us the URL to your blog. A comment to this post is all that we ask.</strong> I will read your blog. If I know you, that is much better (I like to read about all sorts of people but I really love reading stuff by people I know). If I like it (or if I actually know you), I’ll add you to the list of links on the sidebar. Instant Google (and Technorati, etc) karma for you (yea I know, it’s not much but every little bit helps).</p>

<p>Of course if your link is already over there, I know you, love you, and read you already.</p>

<p>In return, if you like reading about our adventures, consider a lil’ link love (wink wink). The internet gods will love you and I will too.</p>

<p>‘Preciate it!</p>

<p>Now of course if no one replies I’ll feel real special. You know, like the kids on the short bus.</p>
