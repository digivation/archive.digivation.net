<p><a href="http://www.sonexaircraft.com/">Sonex</a>, a company that apparently builds small sport airplanes, has revealed that it will begin producing a nice two-seater model powered by batteries (of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_polymer_batteries">Lithium-Polymer</a> variety). You will only be able to enjoy 45 minutes of flying time, but the company is hoping to boost those stats by possibly introducing some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fuel">ethanol</a> powered components. The best part of the whole thing, though is, the plane is said to be “vastly less expensive than other things out there”. Now that’s what I like to hear, I always wanted a plane.
