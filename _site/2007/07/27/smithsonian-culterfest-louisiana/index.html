<p><img align='left' alt='frmo.png' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/frmo.png' />While reading a most interesting article about <a href="http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2007/august/pirate-main.php">modern day pirates</a>, I noticed that the Smithsonian’s CultureFest is currently featuring Louisiana! I had a blast while for Dave and Desiree’s wedding, and I hope to return in the near future. If you haven’t been to Louisiana, <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/content/culturefest-la/explore.html">head over</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana">read</a><a href="http://www.louisianatravel.com/">about</a> it (try Cajun Country, I hear its a good place to be <img alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' src='http://digivation.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' /> ), and if you’re feeling lucky enter the <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/culturefest/articles/sweepstakes.php">sweepstakes</a> to win a trip at the end of October.</p>
