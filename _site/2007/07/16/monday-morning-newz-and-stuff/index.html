<p>After a quick run through the accumulated news of the weekend, I’ve filtered out some of the more interesting tid-bits for your reading pleasure:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.newsgroper.com/">News Grouper</a> has a bunch of parody blogs “written” by celebrities from <a href="http://www.newsgroper.com/george-w-bush/">G.W. Bush</a> to <a href="http://www.newsgroper.com/britney-spears/">Britney Spears</a>! Funny stuff.</li>

<li>Looks like Georgia is being rather progress! Apparently we’ve just granted a permit to build the first “cellulostic ethanol plant,” which produces ethanol from cellulose instead of sugar. This should result in a much improved energy harvest. Read about it <a href="http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/798/">here</a>.</li>

<li>Some info on how to <a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/545672/unlock_plastic_handcuffs_police_style/">escape from those annoying plastic handcuffs</a>. That should come in handy. (<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/07/15/howto_free_yourself_.html">via</a>)</li>

<li>Engadget has a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/14/guitar-hero-iii-rock-band-guitar-gaming-round-up/">roundup</a> of Guitar Hero III/Rock Band stuff.</li>

<li>Looks like the Zune DRM has been <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=127943">cracked</a> (again). This will free your purchase and wirelessly transferred music. Oh wait … I use an iPod.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have fun with those links. I’ve got to do a little real work now.</p>
