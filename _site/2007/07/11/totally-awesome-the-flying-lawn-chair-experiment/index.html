<p><img align='right' alt='Lawn Chair Pilot' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/artlawnchairap.jpg' />Ok, I know this is rather random, but some dude out in Oregon <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/nation/4956038.html">strapped a bunch of balloons</a> (105 to be exact) onto his lawn chair and proceeded to take a 193 mile flight – with a bag of chips and a great view (oh and a parachute)! What a great way to spend a lazy weekend afternoon…</p>

<p>Say, does anyone have a few spare balloons? I’m up for it…</p>
