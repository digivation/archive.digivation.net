<p><img align='left' alt='facebook google' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/googlefacebook.JPG' />Don’t think <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#sergey">Sergey</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#larry">Larry</a> haven’t noticed <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6596533/site/newsweek">Mark Zuckerberg</a>‘s latest move: opening the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook Platform</a> to anyone willing to develop. Sure, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> has the market on what people are looking for, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_book">Facebook</a> has the ace up its sleeve, that is, the social network. Some may argue that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace">MySpace</a> is bigger, but <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> is gaining ground and has an arguably better network. Now, you might ask what advantages would having this network give <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> over the search giant? The answer is distribution. Every new application and feature becomes instantly viral, no advertising needed. Once somebody has added something, a friend will notice and follow, and then their friends, etc. creating a huge snowball effect of distribution. With this sort of power, anything is possible. Perhaps the suits at <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> (they have suits?) don’t consider direct competition with the social networking crowd just yet, but as they <a href="http://digivation.net/2007/06/26/grand-central-googles-newest-acquisition/">expand their ventures</a>, you never know where they will end up.</p>
