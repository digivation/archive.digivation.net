<p>Here’s wishing everyone a happy, fun, and tasty Independence Day! I’ll be out visiting with family and friends most of the day, so I don’t think you’ll find much in the way of posts from me.</p>

<p>Actually, what are you doing reading this? You should be out enjoying the holiday too!</p>

<p>I’ll actually have something real tomorrow.</p>
