<p>I’m currently chillin’ in Midtown Atlanta with the illustrious Ms Stephens. Last night was a blast; we met up with Rob, Trey, Robert, Grace, Leilah, and her friend Emily. We then went out for a “night on the town,” so to speak. Dinner at the <a href="http://www.osf.com">Spaghetti Factory</a>, then a salsa dancing at some little place (I forgot the name), finally topped off with a drag show at Hoedowns. Oh and I got to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Chablis">The Lady Chablis</a>. I really wish I’d gotten a picture with her.</p>

<p>Today we’ve done lunch at <a href="http://www.fresh2order.com">Fresh to Order</a> and some shopping at Lenox mall. I have no clue what the evening holds.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m off for more adventures.</p>
