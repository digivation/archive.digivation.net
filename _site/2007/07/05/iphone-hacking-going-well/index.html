<p><img align='right' alt='iPhone' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/iphone.jpg' />It would <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/07/04/iphone_a_second_attl.html">appear</a> <a href="http://iphone.fiveforty.net/wiki/index.php?title=Major_Release">that</a> the iPhone has been activated on a non-AT&amp;T network. The haxors are hard at work, bringing cool features to your new $600 toy! Current roadmap:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Break DMG Password *COMPLETE*</li>

<li>Break Activation *COMPLETE*</li>

<li>Download a Faked dmg</li>

<li>Unlock Phone</li>

<li>Run Third Party Applications</li>

<li>Allow DUN/Tethering</li>

<li>Remove IMEI Transmitting</li>

<li>Enable Disk Mode</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The broken activation does not mean that you can use the phone on any network. It does mean, however, that the iPod and other non-phone features can be used without service. The cool stuff happens when they figure out how to unlock the phone. I give it two more weeks. Oh and added cool factor: one of the devs in the group is from the ATL!</p>
