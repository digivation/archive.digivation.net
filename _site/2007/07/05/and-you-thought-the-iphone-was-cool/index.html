<p><a href="http://www.theonlyphoneyouneed.com/">T-Mobile</a> has recently released the “<a href="http://www.theonlyphoneyouneed.com/">HotSpot @Home</a>” phone system. It is a hybrid GSM/WiFi phone that seamlessly switches to run on your local wireless router whenever you are in range. The benefits of such a system include an excellent signal in your home and minutes not deducted from your wireless account (while on WiFi). Not only will this work from your home, but also any T-Mobile hot spot or any other wireless network with which your phone is configured to connect. Of course an extra charge would be tacked on your bill, but I wonder if you can surf the net without a per minute charge…? Now, if only this wasn’t T-Mobile, which has pathetic reception here in the southeast. T-Mobile gets this, <a href="http://www.wireless.att.com/home/">AT&amp;T</a> gets their <strike>apocalypse device</strike> iPhone, when is anyone gonna show <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/index.html">Verizon</a>some love?</p>
