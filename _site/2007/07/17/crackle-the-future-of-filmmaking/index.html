<p>Last year, <a href="http://www.sony.com/index.php">Sony</a> bought a little-known <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> competitor (although that might be too much credit) named Grouper. It allowed user generated videos to be shared with <strike>anyone visiting the site</strike> those who might accidentally find the site in a failed attempt to find YouTube. Sony has decided to revamp the site under the name <a href="http://www.crackle.com/">Crackle</a>. This “Crackle” will serve as a proving ground for any budding filmmakers looking to make it big. Supposedly, the creators top-rated videos will be given funding to continue their endeavors, anywhere from $2,000 to $20,000. Not only will the best be funded, but they will be given a shot to pitch film ideas at <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/">Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Television</a>. Animators are offered even greater incentive as one animation each year will be developed into a full-length feature offering the opportunity for an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_award">Academy Award</a>. So, <strike>dust of that old camcorder</strike> pull out your video enabled wireless phone and start making <strike>history</strike> money.</p>
