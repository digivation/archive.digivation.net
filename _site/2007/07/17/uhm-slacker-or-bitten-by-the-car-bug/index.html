No new fuzz from me (since I know your just <em>dying</em> to hear it). Ever since I installed the sub in my BMW, I’ve been hounding the BMW forums hunting down other modifications for my car… and they’re all outside my budget.</p>

<p>I want some new wheels (somewhere in the neighborhood of 18″), a sport suspension (that also drops the car about 2″), tinted windows, clear corners, xenon headlights and projectors, angel eyes, etc etc etc. The window tint I can probably do pretty soon… the wheels, suspension, and lighting upgrades… well that’s another story all together.</p>

<p>Oh and perhaps a supercharger. Maybe I should have looked for an M car instead.</p>

<p>If you were paying close attention, you will notice something rather ironic – I want to lower this vehicle. That would be the exact opposite of what happened to my last vehicle. Of course you must agree that a BMW with 3.5″ of lift would look a <em>little</em> odd.</p>

<p>I’ve also noticed that the sport of BWM modification is a bit pricier than Jeep modification. Oh well… stay tuned. I’ll be doing a writeup on my quick ‘n dirty subwoofer installation soon.</p>
