<p>I don’t know how many of you have seen <a href="http://www.puritytest.net/">this test</a> (warning: those with weak stomachs might be a little offended at some of the later questions) that David pointed out to me the other day. The test is most entertaining and I recommend you take it – it opens up the possibility of conclusively comparing your debaucheries to those of your friends! Let the comparisons begin! The purest person in the room came out at 91%, while the worst was 61%. I think this should become the new thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scene</strong>: A darkly lit and noisy bar.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: Hey there hottie.</p>

<p><strong>Unknown Hottie</strong>: Why hello!</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: I’m only 65% pure. How bout you?</p>

<p><strong>Strange Hottie</strong>: Oooo I’m 75% pure</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: Wanna go work on decreasing that? I bet I can knock 10% off in the next 30 minutes!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s also a funny way to compare yourself to your friends, with the brilliant suggestion of a “Purity Test Party.” Go on, you know you want to!</p>

<p>Oh, and friends: I think we’ll have to hold one of those parties.</p>
