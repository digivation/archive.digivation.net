<p>I couldn’t resist – that was the first thought that popped into my head when I returned to my desk! And it’s Friday – you gotta give me a break!</p>

<p>In other news, I’m headed to the marvelous metropolis otherwise known as Atlanta. I’m planning on visiting with friends, enjoying life, and maybe eating a little food. There is a possibility that I may attend <a href="http://99x.com/events/concerts/index.asp?sb=1&artist=99X%20Unplugged%20in%20the%20Park">99X Unplugged in the Park</a> on Sunday, so perhaps there will be a nice little story and some pictures Monday. But no promises.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you happen to be around the Atlanta area this weekend, and also happen to know my phone number, then give me a call!</p>

<p>And yea, that picture is completely unrelated.</p>
