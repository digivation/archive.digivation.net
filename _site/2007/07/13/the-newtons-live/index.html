<p>Sorry to disappoint but the Newtons aren’t playing live anytime soon (not that I know of anyway). Fortunately I do happen to have this great set of live recordings (previously mentioned <a href="http://digivation.net/2007/06/29/dave-does-la-bamba/">here</a>) just waisting away on the server… so I figured I might as well share! This is the <strong>entire live concert</strong> (edited down to tracks) and presented for the first time ever!</p>

<p>I’m sure this will only interest a few, but give it a shot. If you like it, you’d love the (much better) EP, which was actually recording using “normal” methods and has a much better sound quality. However, the Live album is the only place to find some of their great covers. Enjoy!</p>

<p>PS, I’m sure those of you with sharp eyes will notice that the pictures and recordings are not from the same concert. However, they’re the only ones I had available.</p>

<p><strong>The Newtons are</strong>:</p>

<p>Andy Carter – Bass<br /><a href="http://davidcomeaux.com/">David Comeaux</a> – Vocals/Guitar<br />Alex Daugherty – Vocals/Guitar<br />David Milligan – Keyboard<br />Stephen Spalding – Percussion</p>
