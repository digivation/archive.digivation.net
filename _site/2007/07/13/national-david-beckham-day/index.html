He will grace the roster of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer">Major League Soccer</a>‘s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_galaxy">LA Galaxy</a> and hope to pique this nation’s interest in the international phenomenon that is soccer (and the international phenomenon that is himself). The Galaxy have just released a <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/7013186">new uniform and logo</a> in celebration of their new aquisition in hopes that the design will be classic and withstand the test of time (something that doesn’t favor the MLS). How will the United States react to this invasion? Well, if <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=467960&in_page_id=1779">jersey sales</a> are any indication, there will be 250,000 fans lining up at the gates for his <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=443399&cc=5901">debut match</a> against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup">FA Cup</a> holders <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.">Chelsea</a> on July 21. Beckham comes over to our side of the pond after a brilliant year with his former club <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid">Real Madrid</a>, who he <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=439478&cc=5901">helped win the Spanish League title</a>. The Galaxy were allowed to acquire Beckham when the league revised their rules to allow teams to have one player who would not count against their salary cap (henceforth known as the “Beckham Rule”). We can only hope that this event will help accelerate the popularity of soccer in the US.</p>
