<p>If you’ve never visited the site of <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/">Fake Steve</a>, I recommend having a read. He occasionally gets referenced on other sites, so I stopped by to check it out. Funny stuff – try this quote on for size:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>iPhone has already saved a life. A young woman in southern California called to tell us that she accidentally locked her keys inside her car, and her dog, a tiny bichon frise, was in there too. Luckily she had her iPhone in her purse and was able to call for help. The dog was fine. “The police told me that if I hadn’t been using an iPhone, things might not have turned out so well,” she told us. “They all said that they’re getting iPhones for every member of their families, just for safety reasons. I hope you will let people know about iPhone’s special safety characteristics. And thank you, Steve Jobs. God bless you for what you’ve done for the world.”</p>

<p>Much love, iPhone lady. Namaste. Peace be unto you. And your little dog too.</p>

Just suck it up and drink from the tap. Not that I care about the environment or anything.</p>

<p>Finally, you should, in your spare time, watch the <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks">TED talks</a>. You will learn of some amazing technology that could compose the future of computing (and other stuff). Worth your time.</p>
