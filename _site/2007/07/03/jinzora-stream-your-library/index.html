<p>I just ran across a neat looking piece of software called <a href="http://www.jinzora.org/index.php">Jinzora</a> which claims to allow you to browse and stream your media library over the web, for free. I’ve looked for something like this several times in the past, but never found anything that came with an open source license. Jinzora is GPL’d software, so you don’t lose anything by giving it a shot. I don’t have time to play with it right now, but drop by the site and give the demo a run.</p>

<p>Before you get to excited, I would have you know that it’s a PHP program and requires a web server. This being said, you can run a web server on your home computer for the purpose of streaming your media… though that’s a tad beyond the scope of this particular post. Maybe later…</p>
