<p><img align='right' alt='Sicko Poster' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/200px-sickoposter.jpg' />I’ve been reading bits here and there about Michael Moore’s new movie “Sicko,” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicko">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386032/">IMDB</a>) which supposedly exposes the horrors of the health care industry in America. Not surprisingly, the health care industry isn’t too happy about this, and has recently expressed a little bit of <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?id=215">concern</a>.</p>

<p>Intrigued by all this <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?q=sicko">talk</a> (and <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/07/04/sicko_inspires_grass.html">positive reactions</a>), I decided that maybe I should take a gander at this movie myself. However, it would seem that there are <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/showtimes/movie?z=31210&mid=1809723348">no showings in Macon</a>. Guess I’ll be turning to the good ‘old <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/06/18/moores_sicko_leaks_o.html">P2P</a> method of acquiring this movie. I’ll be back with a little review after I watch it. I’m no fan of Michael Moore (I’m actually rather indifferent), but if it’s good enough, I’ll look into offering a copy (most likely a download or directions on how to get it) for your consumption.</p>

<p>Any recommendations, discouragements, or disputes about Sicko? Leave them in the comments.</p>
