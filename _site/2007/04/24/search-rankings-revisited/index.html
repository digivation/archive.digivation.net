<p>Last summer I did a little investigation as to how well my website ranked on Google for various search terms (a little one sided, but Google is the biggest search engine). When I <a href="http://digivation.net/2006/07/27/search-engine-rankings/">first</a> did the study, I looked at several terms.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=matthew+smith">Matthew Smith</a> ranked somewhere on page 7 (so between position 61 and 70), <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=matthew+a+smith">Matthew A Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=matthew+aaron+smith">Matthew Aaron Smith</a> were nowhere to be found, and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=digivation">digivation</a> landed a number one ranking.</p>

<p>I later <a href="http://digivation.net/2006/08/07/update-search-engine-rankings/">returned</a> to the results to see how my strategic keyword usage modified my rankings. To my surprise, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=matthew+smith">Matthew Smith</a> had risen to position forty, a gain of 30+ positions. Apparently I didn’t revisit any of the other search terms.</p>

<p>So now, almost a year later, I have decided to return once again to my little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO</a> tricks and see what sorts of improvements my original search terms have made. Here are the juicy details:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=matthew+smith">Matthew Smith</a> – now on page three, holding down a respectable #24<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=matthew+a+smith"><br />Matthew A Smith</a> – umm… how’s #196. Thankfully, this is not the most important term<br /><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=matthew+aaron+smith">Matthew Aaron Smith</a> – not even in the top 200. Never mind.<br /><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=digivation">digivation</a>- well, I still dominate this search term. Guess that’s a sort of unique term, so maybe its not terribly fair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope to someday be able to Google “Matthew Smith” and find my website in the top 10. A number one spot would be really cool, but to get that I’m gonna have to release something cool and get a bunch of link love. Either that or blog about myself a lot more… on a side note, <a href="http://www.davidcomeaux.com">Dave</a> is lucky – he has the number one spot for “David Comeaux.” But in my defense, there are a lot more “Matthew Smiths” out there, and his name is in his url, which gives him several points in the search results.</p>
