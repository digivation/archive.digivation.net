<p>This is a random and intriguing idea that I came up with the other day.</p>

<p>I want to create a private wiki (and by private, I mean really, really (really) private). This wiki would be accessible only by me, and would contain all those bits of random knowledge that so easily slips your mind after a few days.</p>

<p>The topics of this wiki could range from notes about certain people (friends, enemies, the president) to solutions to obscure problems that I run across (how to fix that annoying squeak on my Jeep). The possibilities are endless, and because of a wiki’s free-form nature, the assimilation of meandering topics would be quite simple.</p>

<p>Of course organizing this mess would be a nightmare…</p>

<p>There are a few problems with this. First off, security would be paramount – you don’t want someone reading your deepest thoughts do you? Secondly, how do you organize such a beast, so that one, five, or ten years down the road you can still find what you’re looking for? And thirdly, you need an easy way to update this from anywhere, so the wiki would need to support a WAP interface (or accept text messages and turn them into topics).</p>

<p>At the moment, this is nothing more than a brief idea I coined working on a project (don’t worry, there’s no secret website with intimate details about you – at least not that I know of). And while having a little black book of people is a pretty odd idea – but somewhere to keep all those tips, tricks, and random bits of information would be pretty cool. If I ever get around to working on something like this, I’ll inform you of all the juicy details.</p>
