<p>It’s almost summer! Today marks the last day of class, Monday the first day of finals.</p>

<p>I’m excited to see what’s ahead! I’ll be in Columbus, LaGrange, Atlanta, Macon, Hilton Head (South Carolina), Lafayette (Louisiana), and other random places this summer, so give me a ring on the cell or drop me a line (matthew at digivation dot net) and maybe some arrangements can be made.</p>
