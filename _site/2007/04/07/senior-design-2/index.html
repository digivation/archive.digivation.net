<p>My CDR (<strong>C</strong>ritical <strong>D</strong>esign <strong>R</strong>eview) is due on Monday, so the weekend has been spent attempting to complete the remaining parts of the document. Last semester when my team and I wrote our PDR (<strong>P</strong>reliminary <strong>D</strong>esign <strong>R</strong>eview), we spent a hectic evening emailing word documents back and forth in an attempt to collaboratively produce a coherent document. The result was less than satisfactory (in fact I was rather embarrassed).</p>

<p>In an attempt to learn from past mistakes and apply a little knowledge from one of my Technical Communication classes, I came up with the brilliant idea to implement a Wiki to assist us with collaborating on our CDR. At this point, I am quite pleased with the results. I believe that when all is said and done, we will have managed to create a much more coherent and meaningful document while expending less work than before. Hurray, world wide web!</p>

<p>If you are curious (or bored), you can follow the progress of our CDR at the <a href="http://digivation.net/senior_design/">Senior Design Wiki</a>. My only regret is that I didn’t create this site at the beginning of senior design; it would have served as an excellent repository for all the documents, notes, tests, and other odds and ends related to such a project. Oh well – we live and learn, right?</p>

<p>As a side note, if anyone is curious, I’m using <a href="http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki">DokuWiki</a>, a very slim but powerful PHP-based Wiki software. And if you want to come to the presentation, it is scheduled for 1 PM on Wednesday, April 11th in room 204A of the Engineering Building at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?q=mercer+university&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF-8&client=firefox-a&num=10&om=1&hl=en&z=18&ll=32.827249,-83.649017&spn=0.003187,0.005021&t=h&msid=113001744340219610496.00000111cefe8ac56dd2b&msa=0">Mercer University</a>.</p>
