<p><strong>Problem 1</strong>: When I returned to the computer, I had some fifteen “undeliverable emails” that appeared to be sent from some random @digivation.net email. After investigating the logs and poking around, it would seem some jerkoff is <a href="http://frankdzedzy.com/2005/12/13/email-address-spoofing/">spoofing email addresses using my domain</a>. Unfortunately there’s nothing I can do about it (read the article for background info).</p>

<p><strong>Problem 2</strong>: All pages besides the homepage are returning 404 errors. Everything seemed to be working fine a couple of hours ago, so I’m not sure what happened. I was playing around with my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Htaccess">.htaccess file</a> earlier, so it’s possible I messed it up. This problem hasn’t been solved yet, but I’m working on it. You can browse the site by clicking on links, but most links you follow here from google or elsewhere will be broken until I repair redirects.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: It seems everything is fixed except for Gallery. I’ll try to have that back up later.</p>

<p><strong>Final Update</strong>: Looks like everything is back to normal, more or less!</p>
