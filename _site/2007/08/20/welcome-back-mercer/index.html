<p>And Greek Rush.</p>

<p>This marks my fifth year at Mercer and my third as a Greek gentleman. This will also be my last year and my last opportunity to shape the future of my brotherhood, so expect a continued lack of updates over the next couple of weeks as I help introduce those bright eyed freshmen to the joys of college life!</p>
