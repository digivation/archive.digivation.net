<p><img alt='Christopher Walken! Chicken!' class='right' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/walkencooks.jpg' />I just stumbled across a <a href="http://www.imcooked.com/">site</a> that allows you to share “cooking videos,” kind of like YouTube, but for recipes. I find this quite intriguing, as I enjoy dabbling in the culinary arts from time to time, yet I don’t understand half the directions in some of those fancy recipes.</p>

<p>Imagine my delight when I discovered that Christopher Walken (yes, <em>the</em> Christopher Walken) has posted a <a href="http://www.imcooked.com/view_video.php?viewkey=5ff68e3e25b9114205d4">video</a> on how to bake chicken!</p>
