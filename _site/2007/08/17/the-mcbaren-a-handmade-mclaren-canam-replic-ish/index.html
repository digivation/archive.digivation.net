<p><img alt='McBaren' class='right' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/image8.jpg' />Two years ago, Dick Bear decided to fulfill one of his lifelong dreams and build a replica of the <a href="http://www.mclaren.com/historyofmclaren/canam.php">McLaren CanAm racecars</a>. He proceeded to construct a semi-faithful replica (though itâ€™s only powered by a Honda engine) to work on his metal skills and build something cool.</p>

<p>I really wish I had the time (and money and tools and space) to do something like this. However, <a href="http://www.metalmeet.com/forum/showthread.php?t=4020">reading about it</a> is a pretty good alternative, I suppose. Of course <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_F1">the car I want</a> is a little harder to build and ridiculously hard to get a hold of.</p>
