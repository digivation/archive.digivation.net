<p>In case you’re wondering, Chappie and I are still alive, despite reports of our recent demise. We’ve just been busy working on other things this week, and plan to return to regular blogging within the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>The new theme is almost complete (it is now to the testing phase) and should be arriving any day now. As for our “big secret project,” that is still in the works and shall be unveiled soon. Of course it probably won’t excite you as much as I’m making it out to, but that’s ok.</p>

<p>So stay tuned, we’re still here!</p>
