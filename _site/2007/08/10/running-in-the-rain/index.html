<p><img alt='Running in the Rain' class='left' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/runningintherain.jpg' />Have you ever run in the rain? If not, I highly recommend the experience, as it is quite refreshing. Last night, after a long days’ work (and washing my car), I went out for my daily run. About three minutes in, the rain started coming down a few drops at a time, and by the time I completed my first lap, the floodgates were opened. After becoming thoroughly drenched to the bone, the run was quite pleasant and offered a welcome change to the 100+ F weather we’ve been having lately.</p>

<p>So next time it rains, don’t sit around the house. Go running!</p>
