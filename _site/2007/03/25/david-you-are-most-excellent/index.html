<p>So, I randomly decided to head over to my friend <a href="http://www.davidcomeaux.com">David Comeaux’s site</a> and check out his latest music… and I must say, I am quite pleased with the aural goodness hiding in the nooks and crannies! David’s latest song <a href="http://www.davidcomeaux.com/mp3/Calendar.mp3">Calendar</a>, is an excellent example of his music. Over the years, David’s style has become more polished and matured, and I must say, I really like where it’s heading. Keep it up Dave!</p>
