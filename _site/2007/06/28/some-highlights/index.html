<p>Since we are working on preparing a few site upgrades, I went through every post on digivation to perform a little maintenance. In the process of tagging, spell checking, and executing other editorial duties, I noticed a few “oldies but goodies” from last year, and thus, I give you “Back in the Day”:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want to learn something, why not check out “<a href="http://digivation.net/2006/08/11/why-telephones-use-negative-forty-eight-volts-dc/">Why Telephones Use Negative 48 Volts DC</a>,” a lengthy post highlighting a few things I learned last summer.</li>

<li>For all your recruitment needs, try “<a href="http://digivation.net/2006/08/07/building-an-effective-recruitment-strategy/">Building an Effective Recruitment Strategy</a>,” one of a few posts relating my experiences as ATO’s recruitment chair for the 2006-2007 school year. The “<a href="http://digivation.net/2006/11/04/ato-alpha-zeta-2006-recruitment-materials/">ATO Alpha Zeta Recruitment Materials</a>” post goes quite nicely with this. Not surprisingly, these has been getting some hits as we near the recruitment season.</li>

<li>For a little light “motivational” reading, check out “<a href="http://digivation.net/2007/04/24/apathy-and-procrastination/">Apathy and Procrastination</a>” and “<a href="http://digivation.net/2006/03/15/thats-why-you-dont-fuck-around/">That’s Why You Don’t Fsck Around</a>.” Perhaps these will be eye-openers for someone besides myself.</li>

<li>To dance on the lighter side of life, give “<a href="http://digivation.net/2006/05/23/hey-ma-i-failed-engrish-for-the-twelfth-time/">Hey Ma, I Failed Engrish – For the Twelfth Time!</a>” and “<a href="http://digivation.net/2006/04/20/christian-nudists-derriere-advertising/">Christian Nudists / Derriere Advertising</a>” a spin. You could also try out the new tagging system with a look at <a href="http://digivation.net/index.php?tag=humor">humor</a>.</li>

<li>Finally, I present you with two short pieces, “<a href="http://digivation.net/2006/06/15/writers-block/">Writer’s Block</a>” and “<a href="http://digivation.net/2006/07/06/listening-to-coffee-while-drinking-jazz/">Listening to Coffee While Drinking Jazz</a>.” For some reason, I just enjoy the writing style on those two.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s always fun (for me, at least) to go back and read through old posts from time to time. Occasionally I’ll stumble across a forgotten literary gem, other times I’ll just laugh at how bad my writing was/is. And I’ll always come away with new ideas.</p>
