<p>Have you ever watched a trapped fly making futile escape attempts, repeatedly crashing into a window, then fluttering around dazed before repeating the stunt? With the <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> spam filter built into Wordpres, the comment spammers bear quite a resemblance to the aforementioned fly (man that sounded almost like a commercial…).</p>

<p>A statistic on the front page of Akismet states that “94% of all comments are spam.” I must agree; for the 71 legitimate comments currently posted to this site since January 2006, the Akismet filter has captured 7,211 spam comments – putting my site at an even more astounding ratio: 99.02% of all comments are spam! If I had to manually moderate every single message, I’d be forced to disable commenting – but thanks to Akismet and it’s community of users, I can click a handy “delete all” button and *poof* no more spam.</p>

<p>Now occasionally I glance over the Akismet spam queue… and usually its the same old “Hey nice site, visit mine:” followed by 15 links titled “buy zanax now!” and left by some dimwit named “Bob” or “Bill” with an email address composed of random letters. Today, however, I had one curious comment awaiting me (not yet marked as spam). It went something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What would you do if you<br />Knew all of the things we knew<br />Would you stand up for truth<br />Or would you turn away too<br />And then what if you saw<br />All of the things thats wrong<br />Would you stand tall and strong<br />Or would you turn and walk away</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Followed by a link to some site I’d never heard of. Seeing as how this was posted as a comment to the “About” page (which doesn’t even have a comment box) and it didn’t make a lot of sense, I had to check the link out… and it appears to belong a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scraper_site">content scraper</a> trying to make an easy buck. So – a quick click on “Spam It” and that problem was solved (for me and every one else using Akismet).</p>

<p>See, Akismet is peer-to-peer spam blocking. By marking a comment as spam, you enter that into the Akismet database and it will be filtered automatically in the future. The power of the network – like an invisible glass wall for all those stupid spammers!</p>

<p>The moral of the story? Get Akismet… oh and P2P isn’t always bad – in fact, in my opinion, it’s always good.</p>
