<p>In order to keep ourselves out of hot water, I have resorted to amassing a few handy resources. In case you are also contemplating risky journalism, I recommend you visit these links and make sure that you cover your bases.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eff.org/bloggers/lg/">EFF’s Legal Guide for Bloggers</a> – This is a great resource, presented as a list of questions related to various topics. The guide is very easy to read and covers a wide variety of topics, including intellectual property law, defamation law, copyright law, and much more. If you only read one guide, I’d recommend reading this one. (<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/06/13/eff_legal_guide_for_.html">via</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/05/10/legal_guide_for_podc.html">Legal Guide for Podcasters</a> – while we are yet to enter the podcasting game, it has been discussed as a possible future addition. This guide could come in quite handy! (<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/05/10/legal_guide_for_podc.html">via</a>)</p>
