<p>I was doing a little key word study on Google (you know, typing stuff into Google and looking for certain results) when I stumbled across this (very obnoxious and offensive) <a href='http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:b-ljeAFfqpwJ:www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/may2007/20070515_warner-chappell-jackson-ritchie-jones.pdf' rel='nofollow'>document</a> (from Google Cache – the site appears to be down). The domain is godhatesfags.com and is registered to Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas. The document is a flier from May 2007 encouraging members to protest Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie (amongst others), apparently over the song “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_the_World">We Are the World</a>.” What ever happened to that Christian love?</p>

<p>If you really want to see more of this insanity, Google Cache happily serves up the <a href='http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:6zbIxG60EugJ:www.godhatesfags.com/' rel='nofollow'>homepage</a>. If you need more evidence, here is the <a href='http://www.networksolutions.com/whois/results.jsp?domain=godhatesfags.com' rel='nofollow'>whois info</a> on the domain.</p>
