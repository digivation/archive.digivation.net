<p>Since the last round of keyword investigations, we have started posting a lot and have added another name to the bill. Yesterday, Chappie (whom has also become intrigued with this phenomena), informed me that searches for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=matthew+smith">Matthew Smith</a> returned digivation.net as result number sixteen. It seems that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=michael+chappell">Michael Chappell</a> has not yet broken into the limelight, but I’m sure that will change quickly – there are far fewer Michael Chappells then Matthew Smiths. However, searching for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Matthew+Smith+Michael+Chappell">Matthew Smith Michael Chappell</a> strikes gold (number one) – it would seem that we are the only dynamic duo using those names.</p>

<p>With the recent level of increased web site productivity, we have also been turning up for a variety of other search terms related to the various articles found here. Google, working exactly as it should!</p>

<p>In other news, tagging has now been enabled and I have gone back and tagged all prior articles (in addition to performing a little spell-checking). This should make it somewhat easier to find relevant content!</p>
