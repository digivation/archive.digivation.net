<p>And physically. Or I could go with my alternate title “North Carolina, Come on and Raise Up”. Either way, James Taylor and Petey Pablo have something in common, and I am headed to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina">Tar Heel State</a>. Not to see any <a href="http://www.unc.edu/">Tarheels</a> though, actually, to see the marriage of a <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/">Wolfpack</a> (a wolfpack of one?) and a <a href="http://www.duke.edu/">Blue Devil</a>, the latter of which being my sister. So I will be unable to post for a few days, but do not despair, I’m sure my colleague has plenty in store for you. I plan to take some photos during the course of this journey (which I will be making with my two younger brothers) and upon my return will share some choice ones with you as well as relate few tales of the adventure.</p>
