<p>Tomorrow is Saturday, and Saturday will find me at work. You see, I can clock as much overtime as I wish. And last weekend I got myself a nice shiny speeding ticket in my nice shiny new car, therefore: I’m working. To commemorate the occasion, I present to you a rarity around these parts: the poem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘Twas a rainy and dull afternoon<br />As I sped through the state.<br />Over the hills and ’round the curves,<br />My shiny bimmer did swoop<br />Till down one hill flew<br />A Georgia State Troop(er)</p>

<p>Oh what a sinking feeling<br />Did ‘er light in my gut<br />For ever I knew<br />I was stuck in a rut!</p>

<p>No begging nor pleading<br />Would turn his cold heart.<br />He wrote down the offense<br />And left with a nod -</p>

<p>And One Hundred and Seventy-Five Dollars.<br />Dammit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And thus, I shall be a-workin’ tomorrow. The eight to five, all by my lonesome.</p>
