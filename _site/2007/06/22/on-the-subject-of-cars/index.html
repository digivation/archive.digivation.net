<p>I suppose you could now list my car in the garage of the digivation fleet. Now, we are all familiar with my colleague’s [newly acquired toy][1] as well as the infamous “[one red jeep][2]“, but my addition will bring a whole new flavor to the garage. I’d like to call it “the Champagne Bullet”, but I don’t think anyone would really buy it. I drive a sweet ’98 Toyota Camry. No, it doesn’t go “fast” per say, nor does it handle the off-road conditions very well, but it does <strike>leap tall buildings in single bounds</strike> get good gas mileage, great for [long trips][3], which I find myself taking more often. Suffice it to say that it is a departure from the classic Smithmobiles.[][4]</p>
