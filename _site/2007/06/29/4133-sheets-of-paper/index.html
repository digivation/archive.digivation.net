<p>Four thousand, one hundred and thirty-three sheets of paper – the number of individual pages that Max Tyrie and his friends printed to create this hand made stop-motion music video for <a href="http://www.modestmousemusic.com/">Modest Mouse</a> (the video is below).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Myself and a couple have friends have entered the above into the Modest Mouse video competition. Using green screen footage provided by the band we cut a simple music video. We then degraded the images and printed out each frame sequentially. (all 4133 of them) We then nailed each “shot” of 50-100 posters to various structures and posts. Then using a digital SLR camera with a long exposure we frame by frame shot each poster. Oh, and theres a little video projection (again, frame by frame on the SLR) just to mix it up. There is no compositing, no shortcuts, just lots of blood, sweat and tears, and a huge Kinkos bill!”….

<p>The video is really good and kinda makes me want to try my hand at a little stop-motion film making. Any one <a href="http://photojojo.com/content/tutorials/stop-motion-digital-camera/">bored</a> this weekend?</p>
