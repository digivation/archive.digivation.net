<p>“La Bamba” was an instant classic anytime <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/artist/74491b04-16d8-4586-baf0-d2bcb540fd22.html?short=0&compact=&mbt=0">The Newtons</a> were in concert. Thus, I proudly present you with a live recording of  ”<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Bamba_(song)">La Bamba</a>,” as performed at one of band’s last concerts. The recording quality isn’t the best and it’s sometimes a tad difficult to hear, but for this historical audio clip, I think it’s worth the trouble.</p>

<p>PS. I should probably note here that despite the breakup of the band, Dave still plays music (and is an extraordinarily talented musician, if I might add) and does some really good recordings.
