<p>The official competitors for the 2007 <a href="http://www.xprize.org/">X Prize</a> were recently announced (well, all but the one that chose to<a href="http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/xprize_logo.jpg" title="xprize_logo.jpg"></a> remain anonymous). This year’s X Prize is known more descriptively known as the <a href="http://space.xprize.org/lunar-lander-challenge/">Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge 2007</a>. The teams attempt to construct the next generation lunar lander (obvious from title) and must complete a number of challenges to score the $2 million prize. Now that the background is out of the way, the real story is the father-son team of Paul A. Breed and Paul T. Breed. Their so-called “Unreasonable Rocket” is to be built in their garage for a mere $200k. Note that this is no easy task, not only is the challenge just shy of impossible, but the competition is pretty stiff. The field of nine teams is littered with high-profile veterans and well-funded professionals. It will interesting to see if this team will be able to play with the big boys…I’m rootin’ for ‘em. You can check out their blog <a href="http://unreasonablerocket.blogspot.com/">here</a>.</p>
