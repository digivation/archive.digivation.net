<p><img align='right' alt='Net + Phone = ?' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/phone-to-net.jpg' />According to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/24/google-to-acquire-grand-central-for-50-million/">TechCrunch</a>, Google is in the process of acquiring <a href="http://grandcentral.com">Grand Central</a>. Immediately intrigued by what Google could possibly be up to now, and having never heard of “Grand Central,” I proceeded to investigate. After reading through their laundry list of <a href="http://grandcentral.com/home/features">features</a>, I think that this acquisition will pave the way for a host of exciting new Google tricks – and with that oh-so-slick GoogleApps interface we all <strike>love</strike> <strike>hate</strike> enjoy using. In fact, I’m not exactly sure how I managed to miss this one when they rolled out their beta service last October.</p>

<p><strong><big>What It Is, Yo?</big></strong></p>

<p>According to the main page of the website, Grand Central claims to be the “new way to use your phones,” and lists some of its biggest features: <a href="http://grandcentral.com/home/one_number">one number</a> for all your phones (home, work, cell), <a href="http://grandcentral.com/home/one_voicemail">one voicemail</a> box (with a ton of really neat tricks), and “So Many [other] Features, you won’t believe it.”</p>

<p>I have just signed up for the service and the feature list does make me drool bit. Try these highlights on for size:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Call Screening</strong> – listen to voicemail as it is recorded (and pick up the phone if you wish)</li>

<li><strong>Caller Blocking</strong></li>

<li><strong>Personalized Voicemail Greetings</strong> – you can have a different greeting depending on <strong>who calls</strong></li>

<li><strong>Personalized Rings</strong> – different callers hear different ring tunes (MP3s you upload over the web)</li>

<li><strong>Visual Voicemail</strong> – if you have web access on your phone, you don’t need an iPhone to have visual, random access voicemail</li>
</ul>

<p>And these are only a small subset of the features. I can imagine that Google plans on integrating these things into existing products, such as Gmail (you could get your email and voicemail, all in one place). At any rate, I think the service is pretty cool. I can’t really review it at the moment, because I just signed up. The only difficulty is that to fully use the service, you must get all your friends to call a new number – and I happen to like my current phone number, and don’t feel like getting everyone to change. However, it will be fun to play with!</p>

<p>Fun bonus: you can get a number in <strike>any</strike> almost any area code you fancy…</p>
