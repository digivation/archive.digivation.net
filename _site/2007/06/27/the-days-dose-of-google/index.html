<p>And now, for some Googley Goodness:</p>

<p><strong>Google Docs Interface Update</strong></p>

<p>Google has given <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> a makeover. Flashy new icons, a nice list of all your documents (separated by date), and a new sidebar with various view options (including the all-new ability to organize your documents into folders) greets you upon login. The editor interface (from my brief review) is not significantly changed for Documents or Spreadsheets, though I did notice the new ability to create charts in your spreadsheets (this may be old news, but it’s the first time I’ve noticed it). Looking good, looking good … now when do we get <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=gdrive">gDrive</a>? That’s the feature I really want.

<p><strong>Geotagging for Picasa (web albums) and Picasa on your Phone</strong></p>

<p>Apparently you can now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging">Geotag</a> your <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/">Picasa web albums</a> for viewing in <a href="http://earth.google.com">Google Earth</a> or on <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a>. Additionally, there is a new mobile interface so you can view your web albums on your phone. I’m more interested in the ability to geotag photos than the ability to look at my pictures on the phone (since I’m still in the dark ages with no data plan on my phone), but I’m sure the mobile interface will be great for many people. I am yet to use Picasa web albums (I have used Flickr and Facebook, in addition to my hosted and currently private photo gallery), but may give them a spin with the introduction of this feature. Read more about it on the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/06/put-your-photos-on-map-and-picasa-on.html">Google Blog</a>.</p>
