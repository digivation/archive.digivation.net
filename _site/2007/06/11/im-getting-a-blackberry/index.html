<p>As many of my friends know, I kill phones right and left. I also love cool toys. I’ve only had my Moto RAZR V3xx for about two months. It was great until a little water got splashed on it – now it likes to randomly reboot (update: <a href="http://digivation.net/2007/06/23/the-mystery-of-the-rebooting-razr-solved/">fixed</a>!) when doing important things like answer and make calls. I had settled to live with it for a year or so (being out of my 30 day warranty), until one of my good friends informed me that he was giving me a BB 8700c for my birthday. JOY! Thanks so much Alex!! I should get it this weekend, so I’ll be sure and post my reactions to my very first smart phone.</p>

<p>Now who wants to buy me a data plan?</p>
