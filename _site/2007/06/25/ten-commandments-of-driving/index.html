<p>While I sincerely appreciate my “partner in crime” looking out for my well being (and plan to print out a copy of the “<a href="http://digivation.net/2007/06/24/how-to-avoid-a-speeding-ticket/">how to not get caught speeding</a>” list), it would appear that the good ‘ole Catholic church has decided to make a few decrees of their own. I present you the “<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/06/19/vatican.road.rage.ap/index.html">Ten Commandments of Driving</a>.”</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You shall not kill.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The road shall be for you a means of communion between people and not of mortal harm.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Courtesy, uprightness and prudence will help you deal with unforeseen events.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Be charitable and help your neighbor in need, especially victims of accidents.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Cars shall not be for you an expression of power and domination, and an occasion of sin.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Charitably convince the young and not so young not to drive when they are not in a fitting condition to do so.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Support the families of accident victims.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Bring guilty motorists and their victims together, at the appropriate time, so that they can undergo the liberating experience of forgiveness.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>On the road, protect the more vulnerable party.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Feel responsible toward others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm well there you have it. Thankfully I’m not Catholic, so this (obviously) doesn’t apply to me. Whew – I can still use my car as an “expression of power and domination” without fear!</p>

<p>In other news, Ferrari, in a bold pope-defying move, has been quick to ensure drivers everywhere that <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=oddlyEnoughNews&storyid=2007-06-22T164715Z_01_EIC256489_RTRUKOC_0_US-FERRARI-SIN-ODD.xml">its cars are not a sin</a> to own. Not to worry, they say. Their cars are not intended “as a means for outshining other people and arousing a feeling of envy.”</p>

<p>Nooooo heaven forbid!!</p>

<p>Like I said, I’m not Catholic. Whooooo! I’m off to save up for that brand new Ferrari!</p>
