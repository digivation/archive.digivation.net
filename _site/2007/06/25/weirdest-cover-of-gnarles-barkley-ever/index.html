<p>Check out this really weird, yet oddly cool music video / cover of Gnarls Barkley’s song “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nekInx7DV0o">Crazy</a>,” as performed on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin">Theremin</a> (and other electronic instruments) by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/etherandaether">The Ether and Aether Experiment</a>.</p>

<p>Haunting sound, fascinating to watch! A Theremin is an electronic instrument controlled solely by the capacitance of your body; the musician doesn’t (normally) touch the instrument while playing, but instead moves his/her hands around two antennas which detect changes in the electromagnetic field surrounding them. Ooooo good nerdy fun!</p>
