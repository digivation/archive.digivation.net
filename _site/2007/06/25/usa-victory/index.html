<p>Victory on the greatest stage: the soccer pitch. Recently, the US Soccer team triumphed over Mexico to win the CONCACAF Gold Cup. The tournament features teams exclusively from our side of the pond, but its winners qualify for the Confederations Cup in South Africa. The game proved to be full of excitement, suspense, and heartbreak (well, for Mexico). The fellows from Mexico lead off with a goal by Andres Guardado (it’s ok, I haven’t heard of him either) in the 44th minute. At the end of the first half, it appeared that our friends to the south might walk away with the crown. However, the second half told the true tale. Landon Donovan ties the game with a penalty kick in the 62nd, and only minutes later Benny Feilhaber sinks (can one “sink” in soccer?) a beautiful volley from 22 yards out to win the game. Hopefully, will be the start of something great, like the US team living up to the hype. And if you are wondering, 26 more days until David Beckham graces us with his presence. Watch soccer, it’s awesome.</p>
