<p>When I think “innovation” and “cool new toys,” Microsoft is most definitely <strong><em>not</em></strong> the first name that comes to mind. However, in a surprising turn of events, their R&amp;D guys have been on a roll lately, announcing two new and intriguing new technologies: Surface and Photosynth. While Surface is not a new concept (I’ve seen some really neat tech demos of a similar concept in the past), Photosynth is very unique (as far as I can tell) and promising – if it works like they say.</p>

<p><strong>Photosynth</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/">Photosynth</a> is a new product of Microsoft Labs that “promises to revolutionize the way we look at images.” While this is a tall order, once you see the demonstration you might be convinced. Photosynth is a set of software packages that can analyze a set of images, find common points, and then organize images in a spatially meaningful manner. In other words, it looks at a group of pictures of an object, then figures out where they go in three-dimensional space. To really grasp this, one must check out the <a href="http://www.shoutwire.com/viewstory/72420/Microsoft_Shows_Off_Ridiculous_Image_Technology_Video_">video</a>, or mosey over to the <a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/">website</a> (where they have a live demo).</p>

<p>I can’t wait to interact with my images this way. Sucks that I hate Windows so much… cause it sucks so much.</p>

<p><strong>Surface</strong>(aka “Big Ass Table”)</p>

<p><a href="http://microsoft.com/surface/">Microsoft Surface</a> represents what Microsoft hopes to be the dawn of a new era in computing (and one obviously dominated by Microsoft). While I have seen several really cool technology demos of a similar “multi-touch” surface interface, the Surface brings something new and intriguing to the table (wink): the ability for the interaction surface to recognize and react to objects placed on it.</p>

<p>Let me state that again: <strong>it can recognize and react to various objects placed on it</strong>. This is really cool – sure being able to put both hands on the computer and interact with it in a tactile sense is cool and all, but the ability to recognize objects placed upon the table truly enables the machine to begin to blur the line between what is virtual and what is real. In the <a href="http://microsoft.com/surface/">demo videos</a> (which I really recommend watching), they suggest that your Zune and digital camera (Microsoft brand, of course) could automatically and wirelessly sync themselves when you lay them on the Surface. Imaging placing your camera on your table, and seconds later seeing all the images appear. Or place your MP3 player on the table and your library pops up, ready for you to drag and drop new songs to your device.</p>

<p>Of course this brings up the obvious: all this cool stuff Microsoft envisions happening in a totally Microsoft world: MS Phones, MS Media Players, MS Cameras… you get the picture. Suddenly, that nice iPod just doesn’t work quite as smoothly with your new table… oops. However, it will be really cool to see where this goes. The opportunities for really cool new applications and yet-to-be-discovered possibilities await. Check it out now!</p>
