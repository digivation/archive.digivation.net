Sorry, no secret connections or anything cool like that (though if I drive to Atlanta I could get to look at one 30 minutes before most folks). In reality, I will not be getting an iPhone next Friday, nor anytime in the near future (though I suppose I could work a few more Saturdays and then get one). However, I think that they are pretty cool, and it seems that Apple has recently opened up the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/usingiphone/guidedtour.html">Guided Tour of the iPhone</a> for your investigation (if you haven’t already seen it, I’d recommend checking it out!)</p>
