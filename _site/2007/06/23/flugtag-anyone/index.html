Sponsored, of course, by Red Bull, it makes for quite an entertaining spectacle. I’m sure you will be able to find a myriad of videos all of the internet later today, or you could just drop over to the <a href="http://www.redbullflugtagusa.com/Default.aspx">website</a>. Perhaps one day I will have an entry myself, but for now, I’ll just show you a couple of my favorite designs. Check out the <a href="http://www.redbullflugtagusa.com/Nashville/sketches.aspx">design sketches</a>, I’m partial to “<a href="http://www.myspace.com/celinaflugtag">Eagle One: the Colbert Flyer</a>” and “The Pride of the Southland”. I’ll update you later on the winner.</p>
