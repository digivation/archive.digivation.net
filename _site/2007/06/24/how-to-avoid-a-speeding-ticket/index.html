<p>Obviously, you could just not speed, however, I am placing these tips here mostly for the benefit of my colleague (whose recent acquisitions have granted him some new bad habits), but I imagine there are a few others out there who might find this helpful.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Drive within 5-10 mph of surrounding traffic</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Try to stay in the middle of the pack</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Find a “rabbit”</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Do not change lanes frequently, tailgate or otherwise drive aggressively</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Avoid the fast lane</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Watch for cut-outs and modulate your speed accordingly</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Don’t speed when you are the only car on the road</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If it’s ok legally, get a radar detector</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If possible, drive a nondescript vehicle</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Be aware that appearances count</p>
</li>
</ol>
