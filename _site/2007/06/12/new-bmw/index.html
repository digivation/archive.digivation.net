<p>The “garage” of one Matthew A. Smith just grew by one vehicle.</p>

<p>For my birthday (and Christmas, and birthday after that), I bought myself a 1999 BMW 323i (no I’m not spoiled, I’m paying for this one by myself). Of course, the real reason for the purchase is the cost of gas versus the low gas mileage of the Jeep. However, don’t worry – <strong>I’m not selling the Jeep</strong>! It has found a new (temporary) home at my parents’ house, until I have time to do a little much-needed maintenance.</p>

<p>I’ve had the BMW for a little over a week, and am quite pleased with it so far. I need to do a little maintenance on it, such as changing the oil and fixing a few small details. The performance is nice, the ride smooth, and the fuel consumption quite pleasing (I got 27mpg on the interstate last week, and around 22mpg in town).</p>

<p>As I delve further into this new project, I’ll keep everyone informed.</p>
