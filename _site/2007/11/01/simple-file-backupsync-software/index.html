<p><img alt='ySync' class='right' src='http://digivation.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/ysyncsplash.png' />In his <a href="http://digivation.net/2007/11/01/back-that-data-up">last post</a>, Chappie mentioned some “nifty software” that came with his new WD hard drive that allowed him to sync folders on his external drive with those on his internal hard drive. I’m sure that the software that came with his drive works wonderfully, but I’m also betting that it’s proprietary WD software that you can’t find if you use some other brand of external drive.</p>

<p>There are tons of alternatives available, from full featured (and complicated) backup suites to simple utilities. If you don’t have significant sync needs, I’d recommend checking out <a href="http://www.spacejock.com/ySync.html">ySync</a>. This is a very simple but handy utility that will allow you to synchronize two folders. I use this to copy my music library from my desktop to my external hard drive – it’s much faster than doing things by hand. Since I don’t have any complicated scheme for backing up files (I just need to copy all changes from one folder to another), ySync meets my needs perfectly – and it’s free. Grab a copy today!</p>
