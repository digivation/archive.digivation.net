The rate of increase of storage space has increased drastically – after hovering below 3 GB for the past year or so, Gmail accounts now have 5000 MB and counting – rapidly. In the past two days, the amount of storage has risen by around 100 MB. I guess this will help now that we can send and receive 20MB file attachments!</p>
