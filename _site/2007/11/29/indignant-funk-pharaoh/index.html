I’m sure you haven’t heard of the band, but that’s because they’re new and they’re local. IFP is a funk/jazz/fusion band and all members of the band are fantastic musicians. If you’re wondering what they sound like, you can find their myspace player come see them live at 550 tonight!</p>

<p><strong>Update: The Post Show Review</strong></p>

<p>I arrived at the show just in time for the last few minutes of the first set (I was previously occupied installing Christmas decorations for my fraternity house). The music of IFP is definitely not for the faint of heart or the casually disinterested – one must relax, listen, and <em>feel</em> the music to properly enjoy it. As my friend Nick mentioned later in the evening, “It’s six excellent musicians having a musical hay-day!” And he’s right – each member of the band is an excellent musician, and you give each of them some musical framework to experiment with, then send them out to play. The result? A field of musical color and emotion, surging and ebbing around you. Best enjoyed live or loud (preferably a combination of the two). The perfect blend to drink to… or relax… and forget about the troubles of the day, because nothing matters as you float away on a fantastic ride.</p>

<p>So next time they’re playing near you, grab a friend and a beer and go enjoy!</p>
