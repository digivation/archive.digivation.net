<p>I’m missing in action this week because in addition to the rote work of the week, I’m attempting to assemble my thoughts on Luke T. Johnsons’ book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scripture-Discernment-Decision-Making-Church/dp/0687012384"><em>Scripture and Discernment</em></a>. If you couldn’t figure it out, this paper is for my Christianity class (as was the <a href="http://digivation.net/2007/10/22/what-are-sin-and-redemption">last one</a>) and I’ll be posting it up once I finish it. The rub? It’s due next Monday and I’m going to be out of town all weekend – so I need to finish this by Friday. Yay.</p>
