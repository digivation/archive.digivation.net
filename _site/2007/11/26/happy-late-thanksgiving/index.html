I was so busy stuffing my face and working (at the computer store) that I forgot to post. Oh well â€“ at least I remembered eventually, right?</p>

<p>Over the break, besides consuming unhealthy amounts of delicious food and working to get some cash (and pay off those speeding tickets), I managed to buy a bluetooth ear piece (so that I can appear to be talking to myself in public), watch Beowulf and Hitman (the new movies), and relax a bit.</p>

<p>So now its back to the grind. Two weeks of school, then finals. Here I come!</p>
