And that makes me happy to note that while surfing the ‘net I ran across a new NIN remix CD, <a href="http://yearzero.nin.com/remix/index.html">Y34RZ3R0R3M1X3D</a> (Year Zero Remixed). The album itself is actually quite enjoyable, but the most fantastic part of the deal is found at the bottom of the page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Incudes CD with same track listing as digital download (see above). <strong>Also includes a DVD ROM (not a movie) that contains every track from Year Zero in multitrack format for you to do with what you please.</strong> Mac or PC.</p>

<p>We’ve included:<br />Pre-formatted for Apple GarageBand<br />Pre-formatted for Ableton Live (Mac or PC)<br />Demo version of Ableton Live (Mac or PC)<br />Generic WAVE files at 16 bit 44K that can be loaded into any audio editor</p>

<p>Soon you will be able to share your custom remixes online, and listen to others, at <strong><a href="http://remix.nin.com/">remix.nin.com</a></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love that bands are embracing their fans in such fantastic ways (<strong><a href="http://www.davidcomeaux.com/2007/10/12/music-and-money/">see also</a></strong> the new Radiohead CD, <a href="http://www.inrainbows.com/">In Rainbows</a>). Sure, the music industry is light years behind on almost everything, but that doesn’t mean that the bands are as well. Bravo to those who stand up.</p>

<p>It’s also worthy to note that this is not the first time that NIN has done something like this (they have released multi-track masters to the public for a <strike>couple</strike> <a href="http://yearzero.nin.com/">several</a> songs), but I’m <strike>pretty sure this is the first time anything of this magnitude has been done</strike> perhaps not, see previous link…</p>

<p>Let the creation begin! <strong>And thank you NIN</strong>!</p>
