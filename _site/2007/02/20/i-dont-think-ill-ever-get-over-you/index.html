Yesterday marked the end of an amazing four (almost five) month relationship with one of the most amazing women I know. The worst part of the whole thing? We still love each other.</p>

<p>That last statement obviously leads to the question “why?” The answer is somewhat more complicated, vague, and disturbing than you probably want to know. When all is said and done, it basically boils down to a matter of religious differences between my mother and my ex-girlfriend. Why does this matter so much? What are the ramifications of such a decision? What will I do from here?</p>

<p>The answers to these questions are yet to be found, but I suppose “life goes on.” I still have my support network of family, friends, and of course, brothers waiting to keep me occupied, busy, and distracted, but thoughts of her still linger in my mind. With time, they will fade, but the memories of these months will still remain. These have been some of the best months of my life, and maybe, just maybe, we can pick up somewhere, sometime later. However the future plays out, here’s to you my dear. I hope that life treats you well and that everything works out for the best.</p>

<p>See you around.</p>
