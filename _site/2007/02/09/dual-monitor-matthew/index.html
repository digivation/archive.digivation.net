<p>A while back I managed to get a hold of a few non-functional LCD monitors. Yesterday I finally got around to repairing one of them and I now have a nifty dual-monitor setup. Only problem is that my desk isnâ€™t quite right for two screens, but it will work for now! This should make video editing, research, and various other computing activities a little easier (less window minimizing).</p>
