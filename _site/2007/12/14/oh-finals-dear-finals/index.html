<p>Yea I know it’s 5-7-5-7 but whatever. I wrote it.</p>

<p>And yes, so far I’m actually on track for spring graduation! Kind of scary, since I love college. It would be so much better without the work and huge bill… so yea, I guess I should actually get done and move on to the next phase of life.</p>

<p>Now back to writing my Christianity paper…</p>
