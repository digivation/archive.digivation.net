<p>Oh yea, it’s on! I’m getting ready to head to Louisiana for fall break (next weekend). Which means I get to hang out with Dave and Des, tailgate at the LSU / Florida game, and eat tasty cajun food! I can’t wait! I’ll be sure and snap a few pictures (better ones than I got on the last trip) so you can share in my enjoyment.</p>

<p>Aren’t you jealous!</p>
