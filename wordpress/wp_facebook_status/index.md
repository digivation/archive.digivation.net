**Facebook Status for WordPress**

Ok here&#8217;s the idea: For those of you who don&#8217;t know, [Facebook][1] is a social platform with a huge number of users. In fact, many of the people I know have Facebook accounts&#8230; so clearly, tying the social network of Facebook into the blogs of the users would be kind of cool. Facebook provides an [API][2] that allows for access to a good bit of data in their network, so all one needs to do is tie this into a [WordPress plugin][3] so that we can then call forth data using nice easy template tags (or something of the sort).

Since we must crawl before we can walk, I think it should be simple enough to pull out your Facebook status and display it in your WordPress blog.

Now I just need to sit down and do this.
