From time to time, ideas involving [WordPress][1], the software running digivation.net (and millions of other blogs) emerge from the dusky recesses of our minds. WordPress, being flexible (using plugins and themes), is easy to modify to meet your own needs. Here you can find resources for doing your own modifications, as well as a few that we&#8217;ve created.

**WordPress Plugins **

*   [Super Custom Login Page][2] (proof of concept)
*   [Facebook Status for WordPress][3] (only an idea)

**WordPress Themes**

*   [Digivation K2 Style][4]

**WordPress Links**

*   [WordPress Bits][5]
*   [WordPress Codex][6]
